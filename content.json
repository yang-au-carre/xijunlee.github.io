[{"title":"Reunderstanding Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Gradient Descent Method","date":"2018-06-05T15:53:55.000Z","path":"2018/06/05/Method/","text":"Evolutionary AlgorithmTo be written… Natural Gradient DescentThe goal in standard backpropagation is to keep resampling the gradient of the network’s parameters after every update, and update them accordingly until reaching a (hopefully global) minimum. However, there’s another way we can think of optimization. To better understand it, we first need to understand KL divergence. In simple terms, KL divergence is a measure of how close a distribution is to another distribution. Here, it’s helpful to think of a neural network as a distribution over output values, given an input. For example, let’s take a simple classification network that, given an input image, outputs probabilities that the image is either an apple, a banana, or an orange. If we had two of these networks with the same parameters, their KL divergence would be 0. On the other hand, if the networks had different parameters, they would likely output different probabilities, given the same image. The higher the difference between these probabilities are, the higher the KL divergence is between the two networks. This brings us to the natural gradient. If we blindly update our network in the direction of its gradients, there are no guarantees the distribution of the new network will be similar to the old one. To fix this, we first consider all combinations of parameters that result in a new network a constant KL divergence away from the old network. This constant value can be viewed as the step size or learning rate. Out of all these possible combinations, we choose the one that minimizes our loss function. Basically, we’re adding in a constraint to our update, that the new network will behave relatively similar to our old one. Our step size corresponds directly to the actual distribution of the network, not it’s parameter’s values. This comes with the added benefit of a more stable learning process. Especially when we’re updating using a randomly sampled batch, some outliers may make drastic changes to a network’s parameters. With natural gradient descent, a single update can’t make too much of an impact. Furthermore, the natural gradient updates based on KL divergence, which only considers the output of a network. It doesn’t matter how the network is modeled. Replacing a sigmoid activation with a tanh function would change the standard gradient, but not the natural gradient. Of course, in practice we don’t actually loop through every possible combination of parameters within a certain KL divergence. I won’t go into the mathematical explanations here, but it’s still true that the natural gradient is more computationally expensive compared to straight gradient descent. For more in-depth details, check out this paper or these notes.

Thus, I repo this article whose soure is from here. The Article One of the biggest confusions about “Artificial Intelligence” is that it is a very vague term. That’s because Artificial Intelligence or AI is a term that was coined way back in 1955 with extreme hubris: We propose that a 2 month, 10 man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions, and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. - Dartmouth AI Project Proposal; J. McCarthy et al.; Aug. 31, 1955. AI is over half a century old and carries with it too much baggage. For a very long time, AI was dominated by Symbolists, that is rule-based systems that had “Zero Learning”. In the 1980’s a new kind of AI began to emerge, we termed this Machine Learning. Finally, we had at least “Simple Learning”. The big disruption, however, occurred this decade, when we stumbled upon “Deep Learning” and ever since it has been taking no prisoners. This is, of course, a grossly simplified history of AI. There are actually many different approaches or tribes in AI. Pedro Domingo’s in his book, the Master Algorithm, talks about five different “tribes”. Not to be outdone, A YCombinator user “solidrocketfuel” posts about at least “21 different cultures”.It is important for anyone that plans on doing AI to understand that there are differences in the approaches of the different tribes of AI. AI is not a homogenous field, but rather a field in constant tribal warfare. Here’s an overview: And a quick breakdown: Symbolists — Folks who used symbolic rule-based systems to make inferences. Most of AI has revolved around this approach. The approaches that used Lisp and Prolog are in this group, as well as the SemanticWeb, RDF, and OWL. One of the most ambitious attempts at this is Doug Lenat’s Cyc that he started back in the 80’s, where he has attempted to encode in logic rules all that we understand about this world. The major flaw is the brittleness of this approach, one always seems to find edge cases where one’s rigid knowledge base doesn’t seem to apply. Reality just seems to have this kind of fuzziness and uncertainty that is inescapable. It is like playing an endless game of Whack-a-mole.Evolutionists- Folks who apply evolutionary processes like crossover and mutation to arrive at emergent intelligent behavior. This approach is typically known as Genetic Algorithms. We do see GA techniques used in replacement of a gradient descent approach in Deep Learning, so it’s not a approach that lives in isolation. Folks in this tribe also study cellular automata such as Conway’s Game of Life [CON] and Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). Bayesians — Folks who use probabilistic rules and their dependencies to make inferences. Probabilistic Graph Models (PGMs) are a generalization of this approach and the primary computational mechanism is the Monte-Carlo method for sampling distributions. The approach has some similarity with the Symbolist approach in that there is a way to arrive at an explanation of the results. One other advantage of this approach is that there is a measure of uncertainty that can be expressed in the results. Edward is one library that mixes this approach with Deep Learning.Kernel Conservatives — One of the most successful methods prior to the dominance of Deep Learning was SVM. Yann LeCun calls this glorified template matching. There is what is called a kernel trick that makes an otherwise non-linear separation problem into one that is linear. Practitioners in this field live in delight over the mathematical elegance of their approach. They believe the Deep Learners are nothing but alchemists conjuring up spells without the vaguest of understanding of the consequences. Tree Huggers — Folks who use tree-based models such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees. These are essentially a tree of logic rules that slice up the domain recursively to build a classifier. This approach has actually been pretty effective in many Kaggle competitions. Microsoft has an approach that melds the tree based models with Deep Learning. Connectionists — Folks who believe that intelligent behavior arises from simple mechanisms that are highly interconnected. The first manifestation of this were Perceptrons back in 1959. This approach died and resurrected a few times since then. The latest incarnation is Deep Learning.There are many sub-approaches under Deep Learning. This includes:The Canadian Conspirators — Hinton, LeCun, Bengio et al. End-to-end deep learning without manual feature engineering.Swiss Posse — Basically LSTM and that consciousness has been solved by two cooperating RNNs. This posse will have you lynched if you ever claim that you invented something before they did. GANs, the “coolest thing in the last 20 years” according to LeCun are also claimed to be invented by the posse. British AlphaGoist — Conjecture that AI = Deep Learning + Reinforcement Learning, despite LeCun’s claim that it is just the cherry on the cake. DeepMind is one of the major proponents in this area. Predictive Learners — I’m using the term Yann LeCun conjured up to describe unsupervised learning. The cake of AI or the dark matter of AI. This is a major unsolved area of AI. I, however, tend to believe that the solution is in “Meta-Learning”.In addition to the above mainstream approaches, we also have: Compressionists — Cognition and learning are compression (Actually an idea that is shared by other tribes). The origins of Information theory derives from an argument about compression. This is a universal concept that it is more powerful than the all too often abused tool of aggregate statistics. Complexity Theorists- Employ methods coming from physics, energy-based models, complexity theory, chaos theory and statistical mechanics. Swarm AI likely fits into this category. If there’s any group that has a chance at coming up with a good explanation why Deep Learning works, then it is likely this group. Fuzzy Logicians — This approach was once quite popular, but for some reason, I haven’t heard much about it as of late. One would think that there would be a little more interest here considering the success of the also ‘fuzzy’ approach of Deep Learning. There was a recently published result that showed the use of Fuzzy rules defeating a fighter pilot in a mock dogfight.Biological Inspirationalists — Folks who create models that are closer to what neurons appear in biology. Examples are the Numenta folks and the Spike-and-Integrate folks like IBM’s TrueNorth chip. Connectomeist — Folks who believe that the interconnection of the brain (i.e. Connectome) is where intelligence comes from. There’s a project that is trying to replicate a virtual worm and there is some ambitious heavily funded research [HCP] that is trying to map the brain in this way.Information Integration Theorists — Argue that consciousness emerges from some internal imagination of machines that mirrors the causality of reality. The motivation of this group is that if we are ever to understand consciousness then we have to at least start thinking about it! I, however, can’t see the relationship of learning and consciousness in their approach. It is possible that they aren’t related at all! That’s maybe why we need sleep.PAC Theorists — Are folks that don’t really want to discuss Artificial Intelligence, rather prefer just studying intelligence because at least they know it exists! Their whole idea is that adaptive systems perform computation expediently such that they are all probably approximately correct. In short, intelligence does not have the luxury of massive computation. In summary, there really is a bewildering array of alternative approaches to AI. I am certain that there are other approaches that I have missed. Some approaches are in opposition to each other, while other can be used together synergistically. However, what I want to point out is that a bit of an understanding of what is out there can help you navigate this space.","tags":[{"name":"AI","slug":"AI","permalink":"https://xijunlee.github.io/tags/AI/"},{"name":"repost","slug":"repost","permalink":"https://xijunlee.github.io/tags/repost/"}]},{"title":"2018: Beginning of Career","date":"2018-02-23T09:13:22.000Z","path":"2018/02/23/2018-Career-Begins/","text":"It is a new beginning of my life that I will start my career in 2018.

Go。因为这二者从本质上是一样的，只是前者在网络架构稍许不一样。我觉得先弄懂了Alpha Go之后，再看AlphaGo Zero的优化会有一种理所当然的感觉。 Alpha Go这里开始进入正题了，有了对蒙特卡洛树搜索和卷积神经网络的初步认识，我觉得就比较容易理解Alpha Go的本质了。本节分为三个小节，分别是策略网络(Policy Network)，价值网络(Value Network)以及与前两个网络融合的蒙特卡洛树搜索。 监督学习下的策略网络 Supervised Learning Policy Network 这里的监督学习策略网络p_sigma就是之前提到的学习人类棋手下棋风格的卷积神经网络。Deepmind的研究人员收集了大量的职业棋手的棋谱$(\\vec{s},\\vec{a})$后，利用随机梯度下降方法训练出了p_sigma。该网络的输入是Deepmind按照围棋规则和他们自己的理解构造的人工特征，详见下图，共有48个特征，每个特征是$19\\times 19$的矩阵。因此该网络的输入$\\vec{s}$是$19\\times 19\\times 48$的。然后输出是一个落子概率向量$\\vec{a}$，即在每个合法位置落子的概率。 虽然p_sigma能比较精确地模拟人类棋手的下期风格，但是因为网络结果比较复杂，网络每次计算时间比较长。为了能在后续的蒙特卡洛树搜索中能实现快速走子，Deepmind又训练了一个结构相对简单的快速走子网络(Rollout Network)p_pi。p_pi使用了更少的特征，结构相对p_sigma更简单，因此p_pi会算的更快但是算的没有p_sigma精确。 强化学习下的策略网络 Reinforcement Learning Policy Network先稍微简单介绍下强化学习。 强化学习是一类算法, 是让计算机实现从一开始什么都不懂, 脑袋里没有一点想法, 通过不断地尝试, 从错误中学习, 最后找到规律, 学会了达到目的的方法. 这就是一个完整的强化学习过程. 实际中的强化学习例子有很多. 比如近期最有名的 Alpha go, 机器头一次在围棋场上战胜人类高手, 让计算机自己学着玩经典游戏 Atari, 这些都是让计算机在不断的尝试中更新自己的行为准则, 从而一步步学会如何下好围棋, 如何操控游戏得到高分. 既然要让计算机自己学, 那计算机通过什么来学习呢?原来计算机也需要一位虚拟的老师, 这个老师比较吝啬, 他不会告诉你如何移动, 如何做决定, 他为你做的事只有给你的行为打分, 那我们应该以什么形式学习这些现有的资源, 或者说怎么样只从分数中学习到我应该怎样做决定呢? 很简单, 我只需要记住那些高分, 低分对应的行为, 下次用同样的行为拿高分, 并避免低分的行为.比如老师会根据我的开心程度来打分, 我开心时, 可以得到高分, 我不开心时得到低分. 有了这些被打分的经验, 我就能判断为了拿到高分, 我应该选择一张开心的脸, 避免选到伤心的脸. 这也是强化学习的核心思想. 可以看出在强化学习中, 一种行为的分数是十分重要的. 所以强化学习具有分数导向性. 我们换一个角度来思考.这种分数导向性好比我们在监督学习中的正确标签. 这样子大家应该对强化学习有一个感性的认知了。AlphaGo在构造好了监督学习下的策略网络后，就开始利用强化学习来提升策略网络的棋力了，记这个强化学习的策略网络为p_rho。p_rho在输入、输出和网络结构上与p_sigma可谓是完全一样。初始化时,p_rho的参数就等于p_sigma。之后该网络p_rho利用自我博弈和策略梯度强化学更新其参数，以提升其棋力。实验证明p_rho的棋力确实是要高于p_sigma的。这意味着强化学习网络青出于蓝而胜于蓝；这意味着强化学习网络从人类老师那里学到了围棋知识后，通过自我对弈学到了更多的围棋知识。 价值网络 Value Network Alpha Go中还构造了一个网络，即价值网络v。该网络的用途是给定一个棋局局面$\\vec{s}$，立马根据$\\vec{s}$输出我赢棋的概率$v$。 价值网络v的训练方法依旧是强化学习。更细一点说明如下： 1.针对棋局局面$\\vec{s}$，不断利用强化策略网络p_rho进行自我对弈一直下棋到最后，就会得到一个输赢结果$z=+1$或者$z=-1$。其中1表示黑子赢棋，-1表示白子赢棋；2.不断执行上一步骤，就能得到一系列的$(\\vec{s},z)$对了。将这些$(\\vec{s},z)$对作为训练数据来训练价值网络v。 “融合”的蒙特卡洛树搜索训练好了上述所有网络后，我们现在就已经万事具备了。上述的这些网络都是需要提前训练好的，这个训练过程的时间是非常漫长的，但是训练好之后就可以立马使用。不过，如果只单纯用策略网络去跟人下棋的话，一般是会被人类玩家虐的，因为这样的策略还是太简单了。所以，需要将上述网络与蒙特卡洛树搜索进行结合。下图正是Alpha Go中将策略网络和价值网络融合到蒙特卡洛树搜索的架构与算法流程： 首先，认识一下这个树结构。 树中的节点表示棋局中的一个局面$\\vec{s}$，每个点的状态可以使用价值网络v进行评判其赢棋概率$v$。 每条边$(\\vec{s},\\vec{a})$表示基于某个局面$\\vec{s}$的落子决策，每条边还存储三个状态$P(\\vec{s},\\vec{a})$，$N(\\vec{s},\\vec{a})$，$Q(\\vec{s},\\vec{a})$。$P(\\vec{s},\\vec{a})$是由策略网络p_sigma得到，表示基于当前状态$\\vec{s}$下，采取策略$\\vec{a}$的概率。$N(\\vec{s},\\vec{a})$表示经过边$(\\vec{s},\\vec{a})$的次数。$Q(\\vec{s},\\vec{a})$表示策略值，计算公式见上图。 Alpha Go Zero中的树搜索步骤可以总结为： 1.这个过程的第一步叫选择（Selection）。从根节点往下走，每次都选一个“最值得看的子节点”，直到来到一个“存在未扩展的子节点”的节点。什么叫做“存在未扩展的子节点”，其实就是指这个局面存在未走过的后续着法。选择的依据如上图公式所示。2.第二步叫扩展（Expansion）。对应之前所说的“未扩展的子节点”，就是还没有试过的一个着法。我们利用策略网络p_sigma对其进行扩展，即基于当前局面下给出其所有可能落子位置的概率。3.第三步是模拟（Simluation）。从上面这个没有试过的着法开始，用快速走子策略（Rollout policy）走到底，得到一个胜负结果$z_L$。另一方面，我们还可以利用价值网络v对当前这个局面进行评估，得到赢棋概率$v$。然后将这两个结果进行加权平均，得到一个更加客观的赢棋概率，记为$V$。4.第四步是回溯（Backpropagation）。把模拟的结果更新回它的所有父节点上。这里需要更新的参数有$N(\\vec{s},\\vec{a})$，$Q(\\vec{s},\\vec{a})$。 好了，以上就是Alpha Go原理比较完整的概述了，如果大家对细节很感兴趣的话，还是阅读原文最好。 AlphaGo ZeroAlphaGo Zero与Alpha Go的不同之处 根据我的理解，Zero和之前的Alpha Go的主要差异有三点: 1.Zero采用了新的网络架构。将Alpha Go中的策略网络和价值网络融合成为一个网络，我认为这个想法很自然，因为策略网络和价值网络的输入层和网络隐层的结构完全一样，只不过前者输出落子概率向量，后者输出当前局面的赢棋概率。2.Zero采用了目前最先进的卷积神经网络——深度残差网络(Deep Residual Network)，具体参见论文。残差网络的出现一定程度地缓解了卷积神经网络中的梯度消失的问题，从而使得网络突破深度的瓶颈。换句话说，就是Zero采取的网络升级了，比Alpha Go有更强的学习能力。3.Zero直接用棋盘状态的原始模样作为训练样本。Alpha Go使用了人工构造的特征作为训练样本输入网络，而Zero则是直接用棋盘状态的原始模样作为训练样本输入网络。 AlphaGo Zero中的强化学习 Zero将Alpha Go中的策略网络和价值网络融合成为一个网络$f_\\theta$。该网络的输入是棋盘当前状态以及前七步状态$\\vec{s}$，输出是落子概率向量$\\vec{a}$和赢棋概率$v$。 该网络的参数$\\theta$是随机初始化的，也就是说没有学习人类知识，完全从零开始，这也是AlphaGo Zero中Zero取名的由来。而参数$\\theta$的训练是利用在$f_\\theta$指导下的蒙特卡洛树搜索的强化学习完成的。具体的步骤如下: 1.自我博弈(Self-play)。蒙特卡洛树搜索在$f_\\theta$的指导下进行自我博弈，直到棋局结束。在这个自我博弈过程中，会得到一系列的棋盘状态$\\vec{s}_i$，对应的落子概率向量$\\vec{\\pi}_i$，以及一个最后的赢棋结果$z$。 2.神经网络训练。利用第一步得到的一系列（棋盘状态，落子概率向量，赢棋结果）的来更新网络参数$\\theta$。更新后的网络$f_\\theta$又去指导蒙特卡洛树搜索进行自我博弈。 自我博弈和网络训练交替进行，直到网络参数$\\theta$收敛为止。这样，我们就能得到一个无比强大的融合网络$f_\\theta$。 AlphaGo Zero中的蒙特卡洛树搜索Zero中的树搜索和Alpha Go中的树搜索在流程和结构上可以说是一模一样，如下图所示，所以就不再赘述了。差异是Zero用了一个融合过后的网络$f_\\theta$，这个网络干了Alpha Go中的策略网络和价值网络的活。 小结终于把Alpha Go与AlphaGo Zero系统地梳理了一遍了。不得不感慨Alpha Go以及AlphaGo Zero是科研与工程的极致产物，但也要认识到AlphaGo Zero并没有像媒体吹地那么神，其与真正的智能还是差的很远。最后，我就节选贴上田渊栋最近对于Zero的评论，其写得非常到位和客观。 AlphaGo厉害的地方在于结合了工程和科研两方面的工作，通过大量计算资源和工程优化将一个方向推向了极致，并且同时借鉴了十年来大家在围棋上及在计算机视觉上的点滴进展，围棋和强化学习方向上像蒙特卡罗树搜索，自对弈（俗称“左右互搏”），随机走子盘面估值，用人工特征加浅层网络进行快速走子，权衡广度和深度搜索，权衡从头探索和先验知识，计算机视觉方向上像卷积神经网络（CNN），残差网络（ResNet），旋转翻折样本增强，等等。这些都不是DeepMind团队率先想出来的，而是过去的经验一点点积累起来得到的。只是过去的点滴进步并没有进入公众的视野，而AlphaGo达成了这最后的一步。AlphaGo在业内的影响力并不像在大众中（尤其是国内）那么大。在人工智能领域，每个方法都有优缺点和局限性，没有一种方法是万能的。让在AlphaGo上做出惊人结果的卷积神经网络，早先在计算机视觉上已获得巨大的成功，但让它去拟合含有大量离散特征的广告数据，大家都知道效果不佳；同样左右互搏对其它游戏也有相当不错的效果，但让它去做优化机器翻译，未必有人工标定的数据好。我想主要的问题在于我们之前把围棋这个千年的文化传承神化了，所以现在才有这样大的反弹；若是现在再把AlphaGo神化，那不免又掉进一模一样的圈子里去了。国外对于AlphaGo相比之下要理性很多，在各大论坛上也有更多技术上的深入探讨，而不是陷入玄之又玄的空谈。等到大家有这个实力AlphaGo拆解得七零八落，对它的每个部分都有比较清晰的了解的时候，那我相信它的神秘感，和现在这些疑惑和担扰，也就烟消云散。

Go的主要组件。如果你对卷积神经网络和蒙特卡洛树搜索很了解的话，可以跳过上篇。下篇进入正题，将详细介绍Alpha Go和Alpha Go Zero的原理。当然了，所有的讲解都是以非AI从业者的角度出发，不会有晦涩复杂的数学推导。 （主要的材料还是基于组会上的slides，仍旧是以图片的形式，十分抱歉 Outline下图是本文的一个提纲，大致的流程就是：首先是对问题的定义，这里将下围棋的活动定义成数学上的变换。然后分别介绍了AlphaGo的主要构件(building blocks)：蒙特卡洛树搜索(Monte Carlo Tree Search, MCTS)和卷积神经网络(Convolutional Neural Network, CNN)。可以说正是这二者的有效结合构造出了这个有史以来最强的围棋AI，其实想法相当简单，但是如果要弄清楚原理和优化细节还是水很深的。介绍完这两个主要的组件后，就进入了正题。但在介绍AlphaGo Zero之前，我会先介绍其前身Alpha Go。因为这二者从本质上是一样的，只是前者在网络架构稍许不一样。我觉得先弄懂了Alpha Go之后，再看AlphaGo Zero的优化会有一种理所当然的感觉。 问题定义 首先，我们来将下围棋这么一个活动形式化。 围棋是在一张$19\\times 19$的网格上面进行落子的活动，那么围棋的每一个状态都可以用一个$19\\times 19$的矩阵$\\textbf{X}$表示，矩阵中每一个元素表示对应位置的落子情况，1表示该位置被黑子占领，-1表示该位置被白子占领，0表示该位置是无子的。也可以将该矩阵展平成一个361维的向量$\\vec{s}$。类似地，一个落子的决策也可以表示成一个361维的向量$\\vec{a}$，因为面对每一个状态$\\vec{s}$时总共会有361种落子选择（暂且先不考虑已落子或者其他不合法的落子选择，只是简单地认为有361种落子选择。 下围棋最终的目标是找到一系列的最优决策$\\vec{a_1},\\vec{a_2},…,\\vec{a_n}$，使得我方占领棋盘上最大的地盘（其实我不会下围棋的，围棋规则还是论文调研时稍微看了下，如有不对，请指出）。 蒙特卡洛树搜索 Monte Carlo Tree Search对于现在的任何棋类活动，如何评判我当前下的这一步是不是臭棋，回想一下自己下棋的经历。我们是不是通常会在心里预演我下完这一步棋后，对方会怎么下，然后我再怎么下，然后对方再怎么下……厉害的或者有经验的棋手往往能在心里这么预演好几步，据报道柯洁能这么预演5步棋。设想一下，如果在你下棋时，有一个围棋上帝每次都能告诉你这一步下下去后你赢棋的概率有多大，那么你最后的赢棋概率是不是高很多呢？ 在计算机科学中，这么个围棋上帝的角色可以通过树搜索(Tree Search)来做到。棋局状态及其落子决策在计算机算法中可以以树的形式表示出来，其中树的节点表示棋局的状态，边表示落子决策。理论上围棋的所有状态和落子决策是可以通过一棵树记录下来。而那个围棋上帝就是探索到这棵围棋树的最底部通过赢棋频率来判断当时落子决策的优劣，正如下面这个GIF所示： 对，研究人员们通过这样的做法已经证明了部分棋类游戏是有必胜策略的，比如五子棋，只要先手就必胜。但是，不同棋类的搜索空间（即枚举所有的棋局状态）大小是不一样的，国际象棋的搜索空间是$35^{80}$种状态，这个看上去已经很大了是吧？围棋的搜索空间却达到了$250^{150}$种状态，这个数字已经比宇宙中所有粒子的总数目还要大得多。所以在Alpha Go出世之前，围棋被公认为是AI不可能挑战人类的项目。但是，之后就被打脸的。那么之前科学家是怎么做的五子棋和国际象棋等的AI的呢？正是蒙特卡洛搜索树，说白了，这也是一种树搜索，不过是高效剪枝后的树搜索算法，这对于棋类这种在线活动而言是很重要的，因为规则限定你必须在规定时间内做出决策。 蒙特卡洛树的搜索步骤总共分为四步，大致如下。如果对其细节想有更多了解的同学请参考Reference中的第五条。 上图中每个节点代表一个局面。而 A/B 代表这个节点被访问 B 次，黑棋胜利了 A 次。例如一开始的根节点是 12/21，代表总共模拟了 21 次，黑棋胜利了 12 次。 我们将不断重复一个过程（很多万次）：1.这个过程的第一步叫选择（Selection）。从根节点往下走，每次都选一个“最值得看的子节点”，直到来到一个“存在未扩展的子节点”的节点，如图中的 3/3 节点。什么叫做“存在未扩展的子节点”，其实就是指这个局面存在未走过的后续着法。2.第二步叫扩展（Expansion），我们给这个节点加上一个 0/0 子节点，对应之前所说的“未扩展的子节点”，就是还没有试过的一个着法。3.第三步是模拟（Simluation）。从上面这个没有试过的着法开始，用快速走子策略（Rollout policy）走到底，得到一个胜负结果。按照普遍的观点，快速走子策略适合选择一个棋力很弱但走子很快的策略。因为如果这个策略走得慢（比如用 AlphaGo 的策略网络走棋），虽然棋力会更强，结果会更准确，但由于耗时多了，在单位时间内的模拟次数就少了，所以不一定会棋力更强，有可能会更弱。这也是为什么我们一般只模拟一次，因为如果模拟多次，虽然更准确，但更慢。4.第四步是回溯（Backpropagation）。把模拟的结果加到它的所有父节点上。例如第三步模拟的结果是 0/1（代表黑棋失败），那么就把这个节点的所有父节点加上 0/1。 卷积神经网络 Convolutional Neural Network卷积神经网络是目前深度学习中最炙手可热的大明星之一，其在图像分类、目标识别等多方面都有很好的应用。这里我们讲讲其在图像分类方面的应用，如下所示。 该网络的任务是给它一张图，它能判断这张图是描述的什么东西。当然你先需要训练它，怎么训练呢？这个训练过程就很像小时候爸妈教我们看图识物一样。回想一下，那时候，父母是不是在我们面前摆一堆我们还不认识的东西的图片，然后反复告诉我们这个张图描述的是什么，那张图又描述的是什么。只不过现在这一教授过程的对象变成了计算机，既然要教计算机，那当然要采用计算机的语言和思维。 现在，假设我们要教计算机认识狗，猫，船以及鸟这四个对象。那么首先，我们要准备这四个对象的大量图片，然后告诉计算机这些图片分别属于哪一类。这两个步骤采用更加正式的描述如下：1.首先你要准备好某个图像的像素矩阵，记为X，比如这张图片是船的。2.生成一个对应的one-hot vector，长得像这样$(0,0,1,0)$，其中只有一个1，其余全为零。这个one-hot vector表示的意思是(狗，猫，船，鸟)=(0,0,1,0)，即告诉计算机这张图属于船的。将这样的one-hot vector记为Y。这个向量就是用来指导计算机认识图片的。3.将上述的准备好的一系列X,Y“喂”给卷积神经网络，通过随机梯度下降等学习方法，该网络最终能学会不同对象的特征，从而在限定的物品类别中作出精确的分类。具体来说，就是经过学习后的网络，你随意丢一张图片给它，它能立马输出这张图属于(狗，猫，船，鸟)的相应概率。因为经过了学习，其中属于船的概率值是最高的，属于其他类别的概率接近于零。 卷积神经网络已经在很多数据集上被验证比普通的神经网络有更强大的特征抽取能力。所以目前只要涉及到图像的分类或者识别的任务，一般都想到用卷积神经网络来做。那么，下围棋这里怎么用到卷积神经网络呢？首先，我们要认识到下棋其实也是一个分类问题，就是当前给我一个棋局局面$\\vec{s}$时，我如何在众多落子位置中选择一个最终要下的落子决策呢？我只需要选择我认为赢棋概率最高的位置下下去就行。这么看来下棋也就是一个多分类问题。既然卷积神经网络能模拟人类识别图像的能力，那么它是不是能用来学习人类棋手下棋的风格呢？对，早就有人这么干过了，Aja Huang在其论文中就实现过了这一过程，他从KGS围棋对战平台中获得了大量的对弈棋谱$\\vec{s}$和在该状态$\\vec{s}$ 人类棋手所做的落子决策$\\vec{a}$，将这些$\\vec{s}$和$\\vec{a}$扔给一个卷积神经网络去学习。经过学习后，该网络就能模拟人类的风格进行下棋。 那么很容易想到就是该神经网络的棋力应当是与它模仿的人类选手的棋力相当的。如果它模仿的人是一个臭棋手，那么它的下棋水平也会很臭，如果模仿的是高手，其水平也会相应提高。在Aja Huang这篇论文中，他们训练的卷积神经网络的棋力大概是业余六段。 从函数的角度解释卷积神经网络。不论是人还是机器，我们由某个状态$\\vec{s}$想到对应的决策$\\vec{a}$，都可以看成是一个函数映射$f$，即$f:\\vec{s} \\mapsto \\vec{a}$。这个映射完全是由函数的参数$\\Theta$决定，其实不管是人类还是机器，学习的过程就是在学这个参数$\\Theta$。人类的认知经验其实就是抽象的$\\Theta$，被存储在我们的大脑中。而神经网络通过模仿学习人类的经验参数$\\Theta$，但这个学习过程存在误差（想想上课时老师教授你的东西，你也不可能全部听进去）。因此神经网络学到的参数只是趋近于$\\Theta$的，记为$\\theta$。然后$\\theta$就被保存在非易失性存储器里，供下一次神经网络被调用时使用。 注意到，这样一个学习人类风格下棋的神经网络被称为策略网络$p$(Policy Network），在下文将会被反复提及到。 小结本篇比较详细地介绍了Alpha Go中的两个主要组件：卷积神经网络和蒙特卡洛树搜索。正是这二者的有效结合构造出了有史以来最强的围棋AI。下篇将开始进入正题，详细解剖Alpha Go和AlphaGo Zero的架构和原理。

(Column Generation Algorithm)，搜了一圈，发现网路上并有很多相关的中文资料，难道这个算法太难了？还是普及度不够高？后来找到了一份相关的不错的英文讲义，从头看下来，也就知道了列生成算法大概是在干什么，但是其中原因还是不得要领。 之后，我又认真复习了单纯形法，才明白了列生成算法的初衷和要领，希望本文能把它讲明白。 （最近一直用图片的形式记录，是因为这些总结都是组会上的slides😅 单纯型法 Simplex Method单纯形法是求解线性规划代表性的算法。其基于这么样的一个事实：线性规划是在凸集上的凸优化问题，因此其局部最优解也是全局最优解。而这些局部最优解是会出现在该凸集的顶点上，所以单纯形法的思路就是在这些顶点上移动，一直移动到局部最优的顶点。这些顶点也叫做基本可行解，那么这些移动也就是从一个基本可行解通过基变换(即从众多非基变量中选择一个进基，再从基变量中选择一个使其出基)变成另一个基本可行解，直到不能再使得优化目标更优为止（这里，我们采用线性规划的标准形式，即最小化目标函数）。这个基变换的操作涉及到进基和出基，那么如何选择哪个非基变量进基呢？这里就会涉及到reduced cost rate，即下图中的$c^r_j$。用单纯型法的语言来说就是，通过数次基变换，使得再也找不到一个非基变量使得reduced cost rate小于零，即再也找不到一个非基变量进基使得目标函数减小，这样我们就找到目标函数在其polyhedron上的最优值。单纯形法简单过程如下面这张图所示，但完整的推导请参考Introduction to Linear Optimization的第二、三章相关内容。 列生成算法 Column Generation Algorithm单纯型法虽然能保证在数次迭代后找到最优解，但是其面对变量很多的线性规划问题就显得很弱了。因为它需要去在众多变量里进行基变换，这种枚举的工作量是可怕的。因此，有人基于单纯型法提出了列生成算法，其思路大概就是先把原问题(master problem)restrict到一个规模更小（即变量数比原问题少的）的restricted master problem，在restricted master problem上用单纯型法求最优解，但是此时求得的最优解只是restricted master problem上的，并不是master problem的最优解。此时，就需要通过一个subproblem去check在那些未被考虑的变量中是否有使得reduced cost rate小于零的呢（其具体的做法就是通过求解一个线性最大化问题，即求未被考虑的变量中的reduced cost rate的最大值）？如果有，那么我就把这个变量的相关系数列加入到restricted master problem的系数矩阵中。经过这样反复的迭代，直到subproblem中的reduced cost rate大于等于零，那么master problem就求到了最优解。更详细的过程参看以下两张图： 注意到，这里为什么要把restricted master problem转化到其对偶问题呢？我的理解是，虽然通过单纯型法直接求解restricted master problem能得到subproblem中所需的变量$u=c_BA_B^{-1}$，但是restricted master problem也可能是一个变量很多的线性规划。前面也说过了，单纯型法对变量很多的问题是无能为力的。因此通过单纯型法求restricted master problemde的对偶问题（将restricted master problem对偶一下，就能使得变量数大幅减小，因为这些变量转换成了对偶问题中的限制条件了），能更快地得到子问题想要的$u=c_BA_B^{-1}$。 再次注意到，子问题是一个背包问题，通过求解该问题，我们既可以得到未被restricted master problem考虑到的变量中最大的reduced cost rate，又能得到相应的系数列。 列生成算法经典例子 Cutting Stock

Beta分布要说Dirichlet分布之前，先了解下其特殊情况Beta分布。一言以蔽之，Beta分布是二项分布的分布。二项分布中的参数theta在Beta分布中，也被认为是一个随机变量，因此Beta分布是用来描述这个随机变量theta的。下面用知乎上一个通俗的例子来说明（我觉得这个例子讲得相当好）。更严谨的叙述参看PRML中相关章节。 用一句话来说，beta分布可以看作一个概率的概率分布，当你不知道一个东西的具体概率是多少时，它可以给出了所有概率出现的可能性大小。 举一个简单的例子，熟悉棒球运动的都知道有一个指标就是棒球击球率(batting average)，就是用一个运动员击中的球数除以击球的总数，我们一般认为0.266是正常水平的击球率，而如果击球率高达0.3就被认为是非常优秀的。现在有一个棒球运动员，我们希望能够预测他在这一赛季中的棒球击球率是多少。你可能就会直接计算棒球击球率，用击中的数除以击球数，但是如果这个棒球运动员只打了一次，而且还命中了，那么他就击球率就是100%了，这显然是不合理的，因为根据棒球的历史信息，我们知道这个击球率应该是0.215到0.36之间才对啊。对于这个问题，我们可以用一个二项分布表示（一系列成功或失败），一个最好的方法来表示这些经验（在统计中称为先验信息）就是用beta分布，这表示在我们没有看到这个运动员打球之前，我们就有了一个大概的范围。beta分布的定义域是(0,1)这就跟概率的范围是一样的。接下来我们将这些先验信息转换为beta分布的参数，我们知道一个击球率应该是平均0.27左右，而他的范围是0.21到0.35，那么根据这个信息，我们可以取α=81,β=219。 这是因为： beta分布的均值是$$\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}=\\frac{81}{81+219}=0.27$$ 从上图中，我们可以看到该分布主要落在(0.2,0.35)间，这就是从先验中得到的知识。 在这个例子里，我们的x轴就表示各个击球率的取值，x对应的y值就是这个击球率所对应的概率。也就是说beta分布可以看作一个概率的概率分布。那么有了先验信息后，现在我们考虑一个运动员只打一次球，那么他现在的数据就是”1中;1击”。这时候我们就可以更新我们的分布了，让这个曲线做一些移动去适应我们的新信息。beta分布在数学上就给我们提供了这一性质，他与二项分布是共轭先验的（Conjugate_prior）。所谓共轭先验就是先验分布是beta分布，而后验分布同样是beta分布。结果很简单： $$ \\mbox{Beta}(\\alpha_0+\\mbox{hits}, \\beta_0+\\mbox{misses})$$其中α0和β0是一开始的参数，在这里是81和219。所以在这一例子里，α增加了1(击中了一次)。β没有增加(没有漏球)。这就是我们的新的beta分布Beta(81+1,219)，我们跟原来的比较一下： 可以看到这个分布其实没多大变化，这是因为只打了1次球并不能说明什么问题。但是如果我们得到了更多的数据，假设一共打了300次，其中击中了100次，200次没击中，那么这一新分布就是： $$\\mbox{Beta}(81+100, 219+200)$$ 注意到这个曲线变得更加尖，并且平移到了一个右边的位置，表示比平均水平要高。 一个有趣的事情是，根据这个新的beta分布，我们可以得出他的数学期望为： $$\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}=\\frac{81+100}{81+100+219+200}=.303$$ 这一结果要比直接的估计要小： $$\\frac{100}{100+200}=.333$$ 你可能已经意识到，我们事实上就是在这个运动员在击球之前可以理解为他已经成功了81次，失败了219次这样一个先验信息。 因此，对于一个我们不知道概率theta是什么的二项分布，而又有一些合理的猜测时，beta分布能很好的作为描述该概率theta的概率分布。 结论1：二项分布与Beta分布是共轭先验的。即Beta分布乘上一个二项分布的似然函数后，得到的后验分布仍然是一个Beta分布。 关于其的证明，可以参考reference中的链接。 Dirichlet分布先给出一个结论: 结论2：Dirichlet分布就是由2种结果bernoulli trial导出的Beta分布外推到k种的一般情形。 详细一点地说，二项分布的分布是Beta分布，而二项分布的推广形式多项分布的分布就是Dirichlet分布。 结论3：Dirichlet分布与多项分布是共轭先验的。即Dirichlet分布乘上一个多项分布的似然函数后，得到的后验分布仍然是一个Dirichlet分布。 严谨的叙述参考PRML相关章节。 实践：Dirichlet分布的估计即在给定多项分布中概率向量p的一些样本后，如何估计Dirichlet分布中的参数alpha。关于这个问题，Microsoft Research的Tom Minka给出了两种解决办法。无外乎都是极大似然法，两种方法的差异在于第一种方法是采用拟牛顿法来迭代求最大似然估计，而第二种方法则是稍微曲线救国了一下，先定义两个与alpha相关的值，通过先求这两个值从而求得alpha的最大似然估计，其中采用了EM的思想。具体细节可以参考其论文。 Minka大神同时也实现了其提出的两种方法的Matlab源码，而Eric J. Suh将这些算法又用Python实现了一遍，做成了一个独立的Python Package。我项目中就是直接用的这个，跪谢两位大神Orz!

Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike. In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. We’ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare. 解决思路其实这就是个多分类问题，所以常见的分类器都能解决上述问题。kaggle上的大神们也给出了卷积神经网络以外的思路：比如PCA+SVM。类似的还有很多，比如可以PCA+RandomForest, PCA+Xgboost, PCA+blahblahblah … 但最牛逼的解决方案还是CNN，我自己写了一个PCA+SVM的kernel，得分比CNN低很多。当然，如果做好feature engeering和好好调参的话，应该还是能取得不错的效果。但是肯定不如CNN厉害，不然现在CNN为什么会在图像识别领域大火呢？ 实践要我手写一个CNN是不可能的，既太花时间，我也暂时没那个本事。所以，我就用了Keras+ TensorFlow来实现一个卷积神经网络。 官网介绍：Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow, CNTK or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research. 官网介绍：TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. This flexible architecture lets you deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device without rewriting code. TensorFlow also includes TensorBoard, a data visualization toolkit. Keras是一个高层次抽象的卷积神经网络python库，但它本身是不会做矩阵计算等任务的，需要以TensorFlow作为后端来进行复杂的底层计算。在TensorFlow的基础上，Keras能非常方便地调用各种api来完成卷积神经网络的搭建。下面，简单地记录一下安装Kera+TensorFlow的过程。 TensorFlow安装 (on Ubuntu without GPU support)这里，我用的系统是Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-32-generic x86_64), python是3.4.3，GCC是4.8.4，所以下面的安装就是基于以上环境。建议采用pip的方式安装TensorFlow，下面keras也一样，简直是太方便了。因为实验室服务器没有GPU，所以我就只能安装CPU版本的TensorFlow了。

1290=================================================================Total params: 2,681,194Trainable params: 2,681,194Non-trainable params: 0 我是故意把这个搞的比较复杂，最后kaggle上LB得分为0.98971, rank 652/1924，很多人做到了score为1的地步…… 我前两个卷积层为例说明一下卷积神经网络中参数个数的理解。 首先，我的输入是一个28x28的灰度图，那么输入层是一个28x28x1的结构，那个1是该层的深度。 conv2d_1：第一个卷积层，总共设置了32个filters(滤波器，也叫卷积核，这家伙也是有多个马甲的)。卷积核大小设置为3x3。那么经过32个filter的卷积后，输入层的图像变成了32个28x28的卷积层。（注意filter的数量等于该层的深度）。那么输入层到第一层卷积层的参数数量是怎么计算的呢？因为每个卷积核有3x3个参数，然后每个卷积核还要带一个bias参数，所以一个卷积核有3x3x1+1=10个参数。conv2d_1总共有32个卷积核，并且每个卷积核的深度是1，所以总共有(3x3x1+1)x32=320个参数。这个1看起来乘地没必要，但是它代表了每个卷积核的深度。卷积核的深度与上一层的输出的深度相等。 con2d_2：第二个卷积层，同样设置了32个filters，卷积核大小同样设置为3x3。conv2d_1的输出是28x28x32的结构，即深度为32的28x28的图像。自然，con2d_2的filter的深度也为32。经过con2d_2的32个filter后，卷积得到依旧是28x28x32的输出。参数的数量怎么计算呢？对于con2d_2的一个卷积核来说，其深度是32，每一层的大小是3x3，再外加一个bias参数，那么一个卷积核的参数数量便是3x3x32+1=289个。然后总共有32个卷积核，所以总共的参数数量是(3x3x32+1)x32=9248。 可能con2d_2的参数数量说明的让人头晕，更详细和生动的说明可以参见博文，里面有动图说明了对于深度大于1的卷积核的卷积操作。 关于引入冲量本小节内容转载自 @辛淼 CaffeCN社区（caffecn.cn） 随机梯度下降（SGD）是按batch来进行更新，通常来说下降速度比较快，但却容易造成另一个问题，就是更新过程不稳定，容易出现震荡。 引入momentum的idea是很直接的，就是在更新下降方向的时候不仅要考虑到当前的方向，也要考虑到上一次的更新方向，两者加权，某些情况下可以避免震荡。冲量，就是上一次更新方向所占的权值。 一个小的trick是，当刚开始训练的时候，把冲量设小，或者直接就置为0，然后慢慢增大冲量，有时候效果比较好。 PCA+SVM的实现之后，我又尝试了PCA+SVM的模型，源码戳这里。因为没有专门去调参数，所以LB得分很低，才0.49743…… 不过，我想就算找到了最优参数，其效果也应该比不上卷积神经网络。 DNN零基础入门教程推荐最后，推荐一组深度学习的入门教程，我认为还不错。 零基础入门深度学习(1) - 感知器零基础入门深度学习(2) - 线性单元和梯度下降零基础入门深度学习(3) -

正则表达式相关注解（1）数量词的贪婪模式与非贪婪模式 正则表达式通常用于在文本中查找匹配的字符串。Python里数量词默认是贪婪的（在少数语言里也可能是默认非贪婪），总是尝试匹配尽可能多的字符；非贪婪的则相反，总是尝试匹配尽可能少的字符。例如：正则表达式”ab”如果用于查找”abbbc”，将找到”abbb”。而如果使用非贪婪的数量词”ab?”，将找到”a”。 注：我们一般使用非贪婪模式来提取。 （2）反斜杠问题 与大多数编程语言相同，正则表达式里使用”\\”作为转义字符，这就可能造成反斜杠困扰。假如你需要匹配文本中的字符”\\”，那么使用编程语言表示的正则表达式里将需要4个反斜杠”\\\\”：前两个和后两个分别用于在编程语言里转义成反斜杠，转换成两个反斜杠后再在正则表达式里转义成一个反斜杠。 Python里的原生字符串很好地解决了这个问题，这个例子中的正则表达式可以使用r”\\”表示。同样，匹配一个数字的”\\d”可以写成r”\\d”。 Python Re模块Python 自带了re模块，它提供了对正则表达式的支持。主要用到的方法列举如下 12345678910#返回pattern对象re.compile(string[,flag]) #以下为匹配所用函数re.match(pattern, string[, flags])re.search(pattern, string[, flags])re.split(pattern, string[, maxsplit])re.findall(pattern, string[, flags])re.finditer(pattern, string[, flags])re.sub(pattern, repl, string[, count])re.subn(pattern, repl, string[, count]) 在介绍这几个方法之前，我们先来介绍一下pattern的概念，pattern可以理解为一个匹配模式，那么我们怎么获得这个匹配模式呢？很简单，我们需要利用re.compile方法就可以。例如 1pattern = re.compile(r'hello') 在参数中我们传入了原生字符串对象，通过compile方法编译生成一个pattern对象，然后我们利用这个对象来进行进一步的匹配。 另外大家可能注意到了另一个参数 flags，在这里解释一下这个参数的含义： 参数flag是匹配模式，取值可以使用按位或运算符’|’表示同时生效，比如re.I | re.M。 可选值有： • re.I(全拼：IGNORECASE): 忽略大小写（括号内是完整写法，下同） • re.M(全拼：MULTILINE): 多行模式，改变’^’和’$’的行为（参见上图） • re.S(全拼：DOTALL): 点任意匹配模式，改变’.’的行为 • re.L(全拼：LOCALE): 使预定字符类 \\w \\W \\b \\B \\s \\S 取决于当前区域设定 • re.U(全拼：UNICODE): 使预定字符类 \\w \\W \\b \\B \\s \\S \\d \\D 取决于unicode定义的字符属性 • re.X(全拼：VERBOSE): 详细模式。这个模式下正则表达式可以是多行，忽略空白字符，并可以加入注释。在刚才所说的另外几个方法例如 re.match 里我们就需要用到这个pattern了，下面我们一一介绍。 注：以下七个方法中的flags同样是代表匹配模式的意思，如果在pattern生成时已经指明了flags，那么在下面的方法中就不需要传入这个参数了。（1）re.match(pattern, string[, flags]) 这个方法将会从string（我们要匹配的字符串）的开头开始，尝试匹配pattern，一直向后匹配，如果遇到无法匹配的字符，立即返回None，如果匹配未结束已经到达string的末尾，也会返回None。两个结果均表示匹配失败，否则匹配pattern成功，同时匹配终止，不再对string向后匹配。下面我们通过一个例子理解一下 我们还看到最后打印出了result.group()，这个是什么意思呢？下面我们说一下关于match对象的的属性和方法Match对象是一次匹配的结果，包含了很多关于此次匹配的信息，可以使用Match提供的可读属性或方法来获取这些信息。 属性：1.string: 匹配时使用的文本。2.re: 匹配时使用的Pattern对象。3.pos: 文本中正则表达式开始搜索的索引。值与Pattern.match()和Pattern.seach()方法的同名参数相同。4.endpos: 文本中正则表达式结束搜索的索引。值与Pattern.match()和Pattern.seach()方法的同名参数相同。5.lastindex: 最后一个被捕获的分组在文本中的索引。如果没有被捕获的分组，将为None。6.lastgroup: 最后一个被捕获的分组的别名。如果这个分组没有别名或者没有被捕获的分组，将为None。方法：1.group([group1, …]):获得一个或多个分组截获的字符串；指定多个参数时将以元组形式返回。group1可以使用编号也可以使用别名；编号0代表整个匹配的子串；不填写参数时，返回group(0)；没有截获字符串的组返回None；截获了多次的组返回最后一次截获的子串。2.groups([default]):以元组形式返回全部分组截获的字符串。相当于调用group(1,2,…last)。default表示没有截获字符串的组以这个值替代，默认为None。3.groupdict([default]):返回以有别名的组的别名为键、以该组截获的子串为值的字典，没有别名的组不包含在内。default含义同上。4.start([group]):返回指定的组截获的子串在string中的起始索引（子串第一个字符的索引）。group默认值为0。5.end([group]):返回指定的组截获的子串在string中的结束索引（子串最后一个字符的索引+1）。group默认值为0。6.span([group]):返回(start(group), end(group))。7.expand(template):将匹配到的分组代入template中然后返回。template中可以使用\\id或\\g、\\g引用分组，但不能使用编号0。\\id与\\g是等价的；但\\10将被认为是第10个分组，如果你想表达\\1之后是字符’0’，只能使用\\g0。 （2）re.search(pattern, string[, flags]) search方法与match方法极其类似，区别在于match()函数只检测re是不是在string的开始位置匹配，search()会扫描整个string查找匹配，match（）只有在0位置匹配成功的话才有返回，如果不是开始位置匹配成功的话，match()就返回None。同样，search方法的返回对象同样match()返回对象的方法和属性。 （3）re.split(pattern, string[, maxsplit]) 按照能够匹配的子串将string分割后返回列表。maxsplit用于指定最大分割次数，不指定将全部分割。 （4）re.findall(pattern, string[, flags]) 搜索string，以列表形式返回全部能匹配的子串。（5）re.finditer(pattern, string[, flags]) 搜索string，返回一个顺序访问每一个匹配结果（Match对象）的迭代器。 （6）re.sub(pattern, repl, string[, count]) 使用repl替换string中每一个匹配的子串后返回替换后的字符串。当repl是一个字符串时，可以使用\\id或\\g、\\g引用分组，但不能使用编号0。当repl是一个方法时，这个方法应当只接受一个参数（Match对象），并返回一个字符串用于替换（返回的字符串中不能再引用分组）。count用于指定最多替换次数，不指定时全部替换。 Python Re模块的另一种使用方式在上面我们介绍了7个工具方法，例如match，search等等，不过调用方式都是 re.match，re.search的方式，其实还有另外一种调用方式，可以通过pattern.match，pattern.search调用，这样调用便不用将pattern作为第一个参数传入了，大家想怎样调用皆可。 函数API列表1234567match(string[, pos[, endpos]]) | re.match(pattern, string[, flags])search(string[, pos[, endpos]]) | re.search(pattern, string[, flags])split(string[, maxsplit]) | re.split(pattern, string[, maxsplit])findall(string[,

TF-IDF对于一篇文档，TF-IDF（词频-逆文档频率）能为其中的词赋予权重，它度量的是词语与文本的相关性，而非简单的词频。因此TF-IDF能用来判断文章主题。对于一个文本而言，想要知道其主题或是想知道这篇文档是关于哪个方面的，那么最容易想到的方法就是提取关键字了。TF-IDF可以认为是分为两步来做这个事情： （1）最基本的思路是提取该文本中出现次数最多的词。结果你肯定猜到了，出现次数最多的词是–”的”、”是”、”在”–这一类最常用的词。它们叫做”停用词” (stop words) ，这些词出现的次数最多，但是并不能体现文本的主题，那么这些词就要去掉，而要去找那些“真正”的主题词。对于一个词语i，统计其在文档j中出现的次数，记为tf_(i,j)，这就是词频 (TF, Term Frequency) 的统计了。 （2）在统计了文档中各个词的词频后，我们需要调整那些“停用词”的频率，来挑选出“真正”的关键词。对于一个拥有N个文本的语料库，统计词语i在语料库中包含词语i的文本数，记为df_i，那么idf_i=log(N/df_i)，注意到对数中是文本总数除以包含词语i的文本数。如果一个词在很多文本中都有出现，即df趋近于N，那么其idf就趋近于0。如果一个词只在很少文档中出现，即其df趋近于0，那么其idf就趋于无穷大。 （3）将词频tf_(i,j)乘以idf_i记得到词语i与文本j的相关性,即 TF-IDF算法的优点是简单快速，结果比较符合实际情况。缺点是，单纯以”词频”衡量一个词的重要性，不够全面，有时重要的词可能出现次数并不多。而且，这种算法无法体现词的位置信息，出现位置靠前的词与出现位置靠后的词，都被视为重要性相同，这是不正确的。（一种解决方法是，对全文的第一段和每一段的第一句话，给予较大的权重。 下面再给出一个阮一峰博客中的例子。 让我们从一个实例开始讲起。假定现在有一篇长文《中国的蜜蜂养殖》，我们准备用计算机提取它的关键词。 一个容易想到的思路，就是找到出现次数最多的词。如果某个词很重要，它应该在这篇文章中多次出现。于是，我们进行”词频”（Term Frequency，缩写为TF）统计。结果你肯定猜到了，出现次数最多的词是—-“的”、”是”、”在”—-这一类最常用的词。它们叫做”停用词”（stop words），表示对找到结果毫无帮助、必须过滤掉的词。 假设我们把它们都过滤掉了，只考虑剩下的有实际意义的词。这样又会遇到了另一个问题，我们可能发现”中国”、”蜜蜂”、”养殖”这三个词的出现次数一样多。这是不是意味着，作为关键词，它们的重要性是一样的？ 显然不是这样。因为”中国”是很常见的词，相对而言，”蜜蜂”和”养殖”不那么常见。如果这三个词在一篇文章的出现次数一样多，有理由认为，”蜜蜂”和”养殖”的重要程度要大于”中国”，也就是说，在关键词排序上面，”蜜蜂”和”养殖”应该排在”中国”的前面。 所以，我们需要一个重要性调整系数，衡量一个词是不是常见词。如果某个词比较少见，但是它在这篇文章中多次出现，那么它很可能就反映了这篇文章的特性，正是我们所需要的关键词。 用统计学语言表达，就是在词频的基础上，要对每个词分配一个”重要性”权重。最常见的词（”的”、”是”、”在”）给予最小的权重，较常见的词（”中国”）给予较小的权重，较少见的词（”蜜蜂”、”养殖”）给予较大的权重。这个权重叫做”逆文档频率”（Inverse Document Frequency，缩写为IDF），它的大小与一个词的常见程度成反比。 知道了”词频”（TF）和”逆文档频率”（IDF）以后，将这两个值相乘，就得到了一个词的TF-IDF值。某个词对文章的重要性越高，它的TF-IDF值就越大。所以，排在最前面的几个词，就是这篇文章的关键词。 下面就是这个算法的细节。 第一步，计算词频。 考虑到文章有长短之分，为了便于不同文章的比较，进行”词频”标准化。 第二步，计算逆文档频率。这时，需要一个语料库（corpus），用来模拟语言的使用环境。 如果一个词越常见，那么分母就越大，逆文档频率就越小越接近0。分母之所以要加1，是为了避免分母为0（即所有文档都不包含该词）。log表示对得到的值取对数。第三步，计算TF-IDF。 可以看到，TF-IDF与一个词在文档中的出现次数成正比，与该词在整个语言中的出现次数成反比。所以，自动提取关键词的算法就很清楚了，就是计算出文档的每个词的TF-IDF值，然后按降序排列，取排在最前面的几个词。 还是以《中国的蜜蜂养殖》为例，假定该文长度为1000个词，”中国”、”蜜蜂”、”养殖”各出现20次，则这三个词的”词频”（TF）都为0.02。然后，搜索Google发现，包含”的”字的网页共有250亿张，假定这就是中文网页总数。包含”中国”的网页共有62.3亿张，包含”蜜蜂”的网页为0.484亿张，包含”养殖”的网页为0.973亿张。则它们的逆文档频率（IDF）和TF-IDF如下： 从上表可见，”蜜蜂”的TF-IDF值最高，”养殖”其次，”中国”最低。（如果还计算”的”字的TF-IDF，那将是一个极其接近0的值。）所以，如果只选择一个词，”蜜蜂”就是这篇文章的关键词。 除了自动提取关键词，TF-IDF算法还可以用于许多别的地方。比如，信息检索时，对于每个文档，都可以分别计算一组搜索词（”中国”、”蜜蜂”、”养殖”）的TF-IDF，将它们相加，就可以得到整个文档的TF-IDF。这个值最高的文档就是与搜索词最相关的文档。 下面，再再给出一个利用TFIDF度量两个文本相似度的方法： （1）使用TF-IDF算法，找出两篇文章的关键词；（2）每篇文章各取出若干个关键词（比如20个），合并成一个集合，计算每篇文章对于这个集合中的词的词频（为了避免文章长度的差异，可以使用相对词频）；（3）生成两篇文章各自的词频向量；（4）计算两个向量的余弦相似度，值越大就表示越相似。 词袋模型 (Bag of Words)词袋 (Bag of Words，简称BoW) 是一种统计某个词在一份文档中出现次数的算法。统计所得的词频数据可以用于比较文档并测量其相似性，具体应用包括搜索、文档分类、主题建模等。词袋法是为深度学习网络准备文本输入的方法。 词袋法会列出每个词及其在每份文档中出现的次数。实质上已经向量化的词和文档被存储到表格中，表格的每一行对应一个词，每一列对应一份文档，而每个单元格则是一项词频数。语料库中的每份文档都以长度相等的列来表示。这也就是词频向量，一种脱离了上下文的输出。 通常在应用之前，每个词频向量都需要进行标准化，确保向量的所有元素之和为1。如此就相当于将每个词的频率转换为该词在文档中出现的概率。 Word2vecNLP（Natural Language Processing）问题要转化为机器学习的问题，首先就要把单词数学化表示,就是用n维实数向量来代表一个单词，常见的词向量有以下两种： One-hot Representation例如： “话筒”表示为 [0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 …] “麦克”表示为 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 …] One-hot表示使用了单词在词表中的编号信息，编码方式如下：向量长度为词表大小，单词在词表中的编号对应的那一个维度为1，其余为0。 One-hot表示存在两个问题： （1）维度比较大,尤其在用于神经网络的一些算法时，出现“维数灾难”。 （2）词汇鸿沟：任意两个词之间都是孤立的，不能体现词和词之间的关系（因为编码过程仅仅使用了它们在词表中的编号信息）。 Distributional Representation例如： [0.792, −0.177, −0.107, 0.109, 0.542, …]，每个维度用一个实数值表示 克服了One-hot表示存在的两个问题： （1）解决了维度大的问题：常见维度50或者100。 （2）解决了“词汇鸿沟”问题：可以通过计算向量之间的距离（欧式距离、余弦距离等）来体现词与词的相似性。 这样的词向量称为词嵌入（word-embedding），那么如何训练这样的词向量呢？我们可以通过训练语言模型的同时，得到词向量。

集成学习，（就我目前所学习到的）主要可以分为三大类，Boosting, Bagging, Stacking。Boosting的代表有AdaBoost, gbdt, xgboost。而Bagging的代表则是随机森林 (Random Forest)。Stacking 的话，好像还没有著名的代表，可以视其为一种集成的套路。 Boosting首先，Boosting是一个迭代提升的过程，所以它肯定是串行的算法（尽管xgboost可以在节点分裂属性选择上做并行计算）。基于训练集，先训练弱学习器，然后根据前一个弱学习器分错的样本，改变样本的概率分布构成新的训练集，从而可以训练出一个更强的学习器。这样反复迭代提升，就能得到一系列分类器。最后，将这些分类器组合起来，就能构成一个很强的学习器。 AdaBoost给定一个二分类的训练数据集 T={(x1,y1),…,(xN,yN)} 其中,x_i 是n维的, 类标y_i={-1,+1} AdaBoost算法的步骤：(1) 初始化训练数据的权值分布：D1=(w11,…,wi1,…,w1N),w1i=1/N,i=1,2,…,N(即初始时，每个样本视为一样的)(2) 对m=1,2,…,M(2a) 对具有权值分布Dm的训练数据集学习，得到一个基本分类器Gm(x)(2b) 计算Gm(x)在训练数据集上的分类错误率:em=P(Gm(xi)!=yi)(2c) 根据分类错误率计算Gm(x)的加权系数：am(2d) 根据加权系数更新训练数据集的权值分布Dm+1(3)以上学到了M个“弱”学习器，将这M个弱学习器加权求和：f(x)=sum(am*Gm(x)),最终的分类器为G(x)=sign(f(x)) 总之，AdaBoost的主要思想就是在不改变训练数据的情况下，通过在迭代训练弱学习器中，不断提升被错分类样本的权重（也就是使被错分的样本在下一轮训练时得到更多的重视），不断减少正确分类样本的权重。最后通过加权线性组合M个弱分类器得到最终的分类器，正确率越高的弱分类器的投票权数越高，正确率低的弱分类器自然投票权数就低。 GBDTGBDT的基本原理是boosting里面的 boosting tree（提升树），并使用gradient boost。GBDT中的树都是回归树，不是分类树 ，因为gradient boost 需要按照损失函数的梯度近似的拟合残差，这样拟合的是连续数值，因此只有回归树。Gradient Boosting是一种Boosting的方法，其与传统的Boosting的区别是，每一次的计算是为了减少上一次的残差(residual)，而为了消除残差，可以在残差减少的梯度(Gradient)方向上建立一个新的模型。所以说，在Gradient Boosting中，每个新的模型的建立是为了使得之前模型的残差往梯度方向减少，与传统Boosting对正确、错误样本进行加权有着很大的区别。这个梯度代表上一轮学习器损失函数对预测值求导。与Boosting Tree的区别：Boosting Tree的适合于损失函数为平方损失或者指数损失。而Gradient Boosting适合各类损失函数（损失函数为：平方损失则相当于Boosting Tree拟合残差、损失函数为：使用指数损失则可以近似于Adaboost，但树是回归树） 下面是完整的GBDT介绍。 GBDT(Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) 又叫 MART（Multiple Additive Regression Tree)，是一种迭代的决策树算法，该算法由多棵决策树组成，所有树的结论累加起来做最终答案。它在被提出之初就和SVM一起被认为是泛化能力较强的算法。GBDT中的树是回归树（不是分类树），GBDT用来做回归预测，调整后也可以用于分类。GBDT的思想使其具有天然优势可以发现多种有区分性的特征以及特征组合。 Regression Decision Tree：回归树 回归树总体流程类似于分类树，区别在于，回归树的每一个节点都会得一个预测值，以年龄为例，该预测值等于属于这个节点的所有人年龄的平均值。分枝时穷举每一个feature的每个阈值找最好的分割点，但衡量最好的标准不再是最大熵，而是最小化平方误差。也就是被预测出错的人数越多，错的越离谱，平方误差就越大，通过最小化平方误差能够找到最可靠的分枝依据。分枝直到每个叶子节点上人的年龄都唯一或者达到预设的终止条件(如叶子个数上限)，若最终叶子节点上人的年龄不唯一，则以该节点上所有人的平均年龄做为该叶子节点的预测年龄。 回归树算法如下图（截图来自《统计学习方法》5.5.1 CART生成）： 请注意上图中的下标和上标,$x_i$表示第i个样本，$x^{(j)}$表示该样本的第j个feature。所以上图中的遍历划分变量j的意思是遍历feature和相应的s，找出使平方误差和最小的(j,s)。 Boosting Decision Tree：提升树算法 提升树是迭代多棵回归树来共同决策。当采用平方误差损失函数时，每一棵回归树学习的是之前所有树的结论和残差，拟合得到一个当前的残差回归树，残差的意义如公式：残差 = 真实值 - 预测值 。提升树即是整个迭代过程生成的回归树的累加。 举个例子，参考自一篇博客（参考文献 4），该博客举出的例子较直观地展现出多棵决策树线性求和过程以及残差的意义。 训练一个提升树模型来预测年龄： 训练集是4个人，A，B，C，D年龄分别是14，16，24，26。样本中有购物金额、上网时长、经常到百度知道提问等特征。提升树的过程如下： 该例子很直观的能看到，预测值等于所有树值得累加，如A的预测值 = 树1左节点 值 15 + 树2左节点 -1 = 14。 因此，给定当前模型 fm-1(x)，只需要简单的拟合当前模型的残差。现将回归问题的提升树算法叙述如下： Gradient Boosting Decision Tree：梯度提升决策树 提升树利用加法模型和前向分步算法实现学习的优化过程。当损失函数是平方损失和指数损失函数时，每一步的优化很简单，如平方损失函数学习残差回归树。 但对于一般的损失函数，往往每一步优化没那么容易，如上图中的绝对值损失函数和Huber损失函数。针对这一问题，Freidman提出了梯度提升算法：利用最速下降的近似方法，即利用损失函数的负梯度在当前模型的值，作为回归问题中提升树算法的残差的近似值，拟合一个回归树。（注：鄙人私以为，与其说负梯度作为残差的近似值，不如说残差是负梯度的一种特例）算法如下（截图来自《The Elements of Statistical Learning》）： xgboostxgboost类似于gbdt，但是很多地方经过了Tianqi Chen大牛的优化，因此不论是精度还是效率上都有了提升。与gbdt相比，具体的优点有： 1.损失函数是用泰勒展式二项逼近，而不是像gbdt里就是一阶导数2.对树的结构进行了正则化约束，防止模型过度复杂，降低了过拟合的可能性3.节点分裂的方式不同，gbdt是用的gini系数，xgboost是经过优化推导后的 xgboost是GB算法的高效实现，xgboost中的基学习器除了可以是CART（gbtree）也可以是线性分类器（gblinear）。下面所有的内容来自原始paper，包括公式。 (1) xgboost在目标函数中显示的加上了正则化项，基学习器为CART时，正则化项与树的叶子节点的数量T和叶子节点的值有关。 (2) GB中使用Loss Function对f(x)的一阶导数计算出伪残差用于学习生成fm(x)，xgboost不仅使用到了一阶导数，还使用二阶导数。第t次的loss： 对上式做二阶泰勒展开： (3) 上面提到CART回归树中寻找最佳分割点的衡量标准是最小化均方差，xgboost寻找分割点的标准是最大化Lsplit xgboost算法的步骤和GB基本相同，都是首先初始化为一个常数，gb是根据一阶导数ri，xgboost是根据一阶导数gi和二阶导数hi，迭代生成基学习器，相加更新学习器。 xgboost与gdbt除了上述三点的不同，xgboost在实现时还做了许多优化： 在寻找最佳分割点时，考虑传统的枚举每个特征的所有可能分割点的贪心法效率太低，xgboost实现了一种近似的算法。大致的思想是根据百分位法列举几个可能成为分割点的候选者，然后从候选者中根据上面求分割点的公式计算找出最佳的分割点。 xgboost考虑了训练数据为稀疏值的情况，可以为缺失值或者指定的值指定分支的默认方向，这能大大提升算法的效率，paper提到50倍。 xgboost借鉴了随机森林中的列（特征）采样技术，即在某个节点分裂时，不是在当前节点中所有属性中选取最佳分裂属性，而是在当前属性集合中的某些属性中来选择最优分裂属性。这种方法降低了过拟合的可能性。 特征列排序后以块的形式存储在内存中，在迭代中可以重复使用；虽然boosting算法迭代必须串行，但是在处理每个特征列时可以做到并行。 按照特征列方式存储能优化寻找最佳的分割点，但是当以行计算梯度数据时会导致内存的不连续访问，严重时会导致cache miss，降低算法效率。paper中提到，可先将数据收集到线程内部的buffer，然后再计算，提高算法的效率。 xgboost还考虑了当数据量比较大，内存不够时怎么有效的使用磁盘，主要是结合多线程、数据压缩、分片的方法，尽可能的提高算法的效率。 知乎上关于xgboost/gbdt讨论的经典问答【问】xgboost/gbdt在调参时为什么树的深度很少就能达到很高的精度？ 用xgboost/gbdt在在调参的时候把树的最大深度调成6就有很高的精度了。但是用DecisionTree/RandomForest的时候需要把树的深度调到15或更高。用RandomForest所需要的树的深度和DecisionTree一样我能理解，因为它是用bagging的方法把DecisionTree组合在一起，相当于做了多次DecisionTree一样。但是xgboost/gbdt仅仅用梯度上升法就能用6个节点的深度达到很高的预测精度，使我惊讶到怀疑它是黑科技了。请问下xgboost/gbdt是怎么做到的？它的节点和一般的DecisionTree不同吗？【答】 这是一个非常好的问题，题主对各算法的学习非常细致透彻，问的问题也关系到这两个算法的本质。这个问题其实并不是一个很简单的问题，我尝试用我浅薄的机器学习知识对这个问题进行回答。 一句话的解释，来自周志华老师的机器学习教科书（ 机器学习-周志华）：Boosting主要关注降低偏差，因此Boosting能基于泛化性能相当弱的学习器构建出很强的集成；Bagging主要关注降低方差，因此它在不剪枝的决策树、神经网络等学习器上效用更为明显。 随机森林(random forest)和GBDT都是属于集成学习（ensemble learning)的范畴。集成学习下有两个重要的策略Bagging和Boosting。 Bagging算法是这样做的：每个分类器都随机从原样本中做有放回的采样，然后分别在这些采样后的样本上训练分类器，然后再把这些分类器组合起来。简单的多数投票一般就可以。其代表算法是随机森林。Boosting的意思是这样，他通过迭代地训练一系列的分类器，每个分类器采用的样本分布都和上一轮的学习结果有关。其代表算法是AdaBoost, GBDT。 其实就机器学习算法来说，其泛化误差可以分解为两部分，偏差（bias)和方差(variance)。这个可由下图的式子导出（这里用到了概率论公式D(X)=E(X^2)-[E(X)]^2）。偏差指的是算法的期望预测与真实预测之间的偏差程度，反应了模型本身的拟合能力；方差度量了同等大小的训练集的变动导致学习性能的变化，刻画了数据扰动所导致的影响。这个有点儿绕，不过你一定知道过拟合。 如下图所示，当模型越复杂时，拟合的程度就越高，模型的训练偏差就越小。但此时如果换一组数据可能模型的变化就会很大，即模型的方差很大。所以模型过于复杂的时候会导致过拟合。 当模型越简单时，即使我们再换一组数据，最后得出的学习器和之前的学习器的差别就不那么大，模型的方差很小。还是因为模型简单，所以偏差会很大。 也就是说，当我们训练一个模型时，偏差和方差都得照顾到，漏掉一个都不行。 对于Bagging算法来说，由于我们会并行地训练很多不同的分类器的目的就是降低这个方差(variance) ,因为采用了相互独立的基分类器多了以后，h的值自然就会靠近.所以对于每个基分类器来说，目标就是如何降低这个偏差（bias),所以我们会采用深度很深甚至不剪枝的决策树。 对于Boosting来说，每一步我们都会在上一轮的基础上更加拟合原数据，所以可以保证偏差（bias）,所以对于每个基分类器来说，问题就在于如何选择variance更小的分类器，即更简单的分类器，所以我们选择了深度很浅的决策树。 【问】机器学习算法中GBDT和XGBOOST的区别有哪些？【答】传统GBDT以CART作为基分类器，xgboost还支持线性分类器，这个时候xgboost相当于带L1和L2正则化项的逻辑斯蒂回归（分类问题）或者线性回归（回归问题）。 传统GBDT在优化时只用到一阶导数信息，xgboost则对代价函数进行了二阶泰勒展开，同时用到了一阶和二阶导数。顺便提一下，xgboost工具支持自定义代价函数，只要函数可一阶和二阶求导。 xgboost在代价函数里加入了正则项，用于控制模型的复杂度。正则项里包含了树的叶子节点个数、每个叶子节点上输出的score的L2模的平方和。从Bias-variance tradeoff角度来讲，正则项降低了模型的variance，使学习出来的模型更加简单，防止过拟合，这也是xgboost优于传统GBDT的一个特性。 Shrinkage（缩减），相当于学习速率（xgboost中的eta）。xgboost在进行完一次迭代后，会将叶子节点的权重乘上该系数，主要是为了削弱每棵树的影响，让后面有更大的学习空间。实际应用中，一般把eta设置得小一点，然后迭代次数设置得大一点。（补充：传统GBDT的实现也有学习速率） 列抽样（column subsampling）即特征抽样。xgboost借鉴了随机森林的做法，支持列抽样，不仅能降低过拟合，还能减少计算，这也是xgboost异于传统gbdt的一个特性。 对缺失值的处理。对于特征的值有缺失的样本，xgboost可以自动学习出它的分裂方向。 xgboost工具支持并行。boosting不是一种串行的结构吗?怎么并行的？注意xgboost的并行不是tree粒度的并行，xgboost也是一次迭代完才能进行下一次迭代的（第t次迭代的代价函数里包含了前面t-1次迭代的预测值）。xgboost的并行是在特征粒度上的。我们知道，决策树的学习最耗时的一个步骤就是对特征的值进行排序（因为要确定最佳分割点），xgboost在训练之前，预先对数据进行了排序，然后保存为block结构，后面的迭代中重复地使用这个结构，大大减小计算量。这个block结构也使得并行成为了可能，在进行节点的分裂时，需要计算每个特征的增益，最终选增益最大的那个特征去做分裂，那么各个特征的增益计算就可以开多线程进行。可并行的近似直方图算法。树节点在进行分裂时，我们需要计算每个特征的每个分割点对应的增益，即用贪心法枚举所有可能的分割点。当数据无法一次载入内存或者在分布式情况下，贪心算法效率就会变得很低，所以xgboost还提出了一种可并行的近似直方图算法，用于高效地生成候选的分割点。 多种语言封装支持。 【问】为什么基于 tree-ensemble 的机器学习方法，在实际的 kaggle 比赛中效果非常好？【答】作者：马超链接：https://www.zhihu.com/question/51818176/answer/127637712来源：知乎著作权归作者所有。商业转载请联系作者获得授权，非商业转载请注明出处。 通常，解释一个机器学习模型的表现是一件很复杂事情，而这篇文章尽可能用最直观的方式来解释这一问题。我主要从三个方面来回答楼主这个问题。 理论模型 （站在 vc-dimension 的角度） 实际数据 系统的实现 （主要基于 xgboost）通常决定一个机器学习模型能不能取得好的效果，以上三个方面的因素缺一不可。 （1）站在理论模型的角度统计机器学习里经典的 vc-dimension 理论告诉我们：一个机器学习模型想要取得好的效果，这个模型需要满足以下两个条件： 模型在我们的训练数据上的表现要不错，也就是 trainning error 要足够小。 模型的 vc-dimension 要低。换句话说，就是模型的自由度不能太大，以防overfit.当然，这是我用大白话描述出来的，真正的 vc-dimension 理论需要经过复杂的数学推导，推出 vc-bound. vc-dimension 理论其实是从另一个角度刻画了一个我们所熟知的概念，那就是 bias variance trade-off. 好，现在开始让我们想象一个机器学习任务。对于这个任务，一定会有一个 “上帝函数” 可以完美的拟合所有数据（包括训练数据，以及未知的测试数据）。很可惜，这个函数我们肯定是不知道的 （不然就不需要机器学习了）。我们只可能选择一个 “假想函数” 来 逼近 这个 “上帝函数”，我们通常把这个 “假想函数” 叫做 hypothesis. 在这些 hypothesis 里，我们可以选择 svm, 也可以选择 logistic regression. 可以选择单棵决策树，也可以选择 tree-ensemble (gbdt, random forest). 现在的问题就是，为什么 tree-ensemble 在实际中的效果很好呢？ 区别就在于 “模型的可控性”。 先说结论，tree-ensemble 这样的模型的可控性是好的，而像 LR 这样的模型的可控性是不够好的（或者说，可控性是没有 tree-ensemble 好的）。为什么会这样？别急，听我慢慢道来。 我们之前说，当我们选择一个 hypothsis 后，就需要在训练数据上进行训练，从而逼近我们的 “上帝函数”。我们都知道，对于 LR 这样的模型。如果 underfit，我们可以通过加 feature，或者通过高次的特征转换来使得我们的模型在训练数据上取得足够高的正确率。而对于 tree-enseble 来说，我们解决这一问题的方法是通过训练更多的 “弱弱” 的 tree. 所以，这两类模型都可以把 training error 做的足够低，也就是说模型的表达能力都是足够的。但是这样就完事了吗？没有，我们还需要让我们的模型的 vc-dimension 低一些。而这里，重点来了。在 tree-ensemble 模型中，通过加 tree 的方式，对于模型的 vc-dimension 的改变是比较小的。而在 LR 中，初始的维数设定，或者说特征的高次转换对于 vc-dimension 的影响都是更大的。换句话说，tree-ensemble 总是用一些 “弱弱” 的树联合起来去逼近 “上帝函数”，一次一小步，总能拟合的比较好。而对于 LR 这样的模型，我们很难去猜到这个“上帝函数”到底长什么样子（到底是2次函数还是3次函数？上帝函数如果是介于2次和3次之间怎么办呢？）。所以，一不小心我们设定的多项式维数高了，模型就 “刹不住车了”。俗话说的好，步子大了，总会扯着蛋。这也就是我们之前说的，tree-ensemble 模型的可控性更好，也即更不容易 overfit. （2）站在数据的角度 除了理论模型之外, 实际的数据也对我们的算法最终能取得好的效果息息相关。kaggle 比赛选择的都是真实世界中的问题。所以数据多多少少都是有噪音的。而基于树的算法通常抗噪能力更强。比如在树模型中，我们很容易对缺失值进行处理。除此之外，基于树的模型对于 categorical feature 也更加友好。 除了数据噪音之外，feature 的多样性也是 tree-ensemble 模型能够取得更好效果的原因之一。通常在一个kaggle任务中，我们可能有年龄特征，收入特征，性别特征等等从不同 channel 获得的特征。而特征的多样性也正是为什么工业界很少去使用 svm 的一个重要原因之一，因为 svm 本质上是属于一个几何模型，这个模型需要去定义 instance 之间的 kernel 或者 similarity （对于linear svm 来说，这个similarity 就是内积）。这其实和我们在之前说过的问题是相似的，我们无法预先设定一个很好的similarity。这样的数学模型使得 svm 更适合去处理 “同性质”的特征，例如图像特征提取中的 lbp 。而从不同 channel 中来的 feature 则更适合 tree-based model, 这些模型对数据的 distributation 通常并不敏感。 （3）站在系统实现的角度 除了有合适的模型和数据，一个良好的机器学习系统实现往往也是算法最终能否取得好的效果的关键。一个好的机器学习系统实现应该具备以下特征： 正确高效的实现某种模型。我真的见过有些机器学习的库实现某种算法是错误的。而高效的实现意味着可以快速验证不同的模型和参数。 系统具有灵活、深度的定制功能。 系统简单易用。 系统具有可扩展性, 可以从容处理更大的数据。 到目前为止，xgboost 是我发现的唯一一个能够很好的满足上述所有要求的 machine learning package. 在此感谢青年才俊 陈天奇。 在效率方面，xgboost 高效的 c++ 实现能够通常能够比其它机器学习库更快的完成训练任务。 在灵活性方面，xgboost 可以深度定制每一个子分类器，并且可以灵活的选择 loss function（logistic，linear，softmax 等等）。除此之外，xgboost还提供了一系列在机器学习比赛中十分有用的功能，例如 early-stop， cv 等等在易用性方面，xgboost 提供了各种语言的封装，使得不同语言的用户都可以使用这个优秀的系统。 最后，在可扩展性方面，xgboost 提供了分布式训练（底层采用 rabit 接口），并且其分布式版本可以跑在各种平台之上，例如 mpi, yarn, spark 等等。 有了这么多优秀的特性，自然这个系统会吸引更多的人去使用它来参加 kaggle 比赛。 综上所述，理论模型，实际的数据，良好的系统实现，都是使得 tree-ensemble 在实际的 kaggle 比赛中“屡战屡胜”的原因。 BaggingBagging的代表算法是随机森林，简单说下随机森林的步骤： (1) 对训练样本进行bootstrap采样，即有放回的采样，获得M个采样集合；(2) 在这M个采样集合上训练处M个弱决策树。注意到，在决策树生成中还用到了列采样的技巧，原本决策树中节点分裂时，是选择当前节点中所有属性的最优属性进行划分的，但是列采样的技巧是在所有属性中的子集中选最优属性进行划分。这样做可以进一步降低过拟合的可能性；(3) 对这M个训练出来的弱决策树进行集成。 StackingStacking还没有代表性的算法，我姑且把它理解成一个集成的思想吧。具体做法是： (1) 先将训练集D拆成k个大小相似但互不相交的子集D1,D2,…,Dk；(2) 令Dj’= D - Dj，在Dj’上训练一个弱学习器Lj。将Dj作为测试集，获得Lj在Dj上的输出Dj’’；(3) 步骤2可以得到k个弱学习器以及k个相应的输出Dj’’,这个k个输出加上原本的类标构成新的训练集Dn；(4) 在Dn训练次学习器L，L即为最后的学习器。 以上Stacking只做了一层，据kaggle上的大神反馈，Stacking可以做好多层，会有神奇的效果。 下面给出kaggle中一个Stacking的实例，就是入门级的titanic那道题单层stacking的源码（只给出了stacking 的过程，前面特征工程处理的代码被省略掉了）。Stacking后的xgboost（得分:0.77990)比我之前只用xgboost时(得分:0.77512)提高了一点，排名上升了396…… 源码戳这 Log on 2017-6-22: Stacking了两次之后，得分从单次stacking的0.77990上升到了0.79904 Log on 2017-6-22: Stacking了三次之后，得分从两次stacking的0.77990降低到了0.78469。所以，Stacking并不是越多层越好，反而会变坏。 Reference《The Elements of Statistical Learning》《统计学习方法》《Practical Lessons from Predicting Clicks on Ads at

什么是args和*kwargs？先来看个例子： 12345678910def foo(*args, **kwargs): print 'args = ', args print 'kwargs = ', kwargs print '---------------------------------------'if __name__ == '__main__': foo(1,2,3,4) foo(a=1,b=2,c=3) foo(1,2,3,4, a=1,b=2,c=3) foo('a', 1, None, a=1, b='2', c=3) 输出结果如下：123456789101112args = (1, 2, 3, 4) kwargs = &#123;&#125; --------------------------------------- args = () kwargs = &#123;'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2&#125; --------------------------------------- args = (1, 2, 3, 4) kwargs = &#123;'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2&#125; --------------------------------------- args = ('a', 1, None) kwargs = &#123;'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': '2'&#125; --------------------------------------- 可以看到，这两个是python中的可变参数。args表示任何多个无名参数，它是一个tuple；**kwargs表示关键字参数，它是一个dict。并且同时使用args和kwargs时，必须*args参数列要在kwargs前，像foo(a=1, b=’2’, c=3, a’, 1, None, )这样调用的话，会提示语法错误“SyntaxError: non-keyword arg after keyword arg”。 还有一个很漂亮的用法，就是创建字典：123def kw_dict(**kwargs): return kwargsprint kw_dict(a=1,b=2,c=3) == &#123;'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3&#125; 其实python中就带有dict类，使用dict(a=1,b=2,c=3)即可创建一个字典了。 lambda表达式以及实例lambda表达式可以理解成为匿名函数，其功能就是定义了一个函数，不过这个函数形式非常简单，通常是一行。过于复杂的函数还是正经定义的好。 sorted函数中使用lambda表达式的例子：下面这个例子在很多list排序中使用到，故单独列出来。 123points = [[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]]#用sorted函数来为list中的元素按照元素的第二位进行排序，key是排序的比较关键字，这里通过lambda表达式来给出关键字。points = sorted(points, key = lambda x: x[1]) 简单例子:1g = lambda x:x+1 执行结果：1234g(1)&gt;&gt;&gt;2g(2)&gt;&gt;&gt;3 另外一种使用方式:12lambda x:x+1(1)&gt;&gt;&gt;2 可以这样认为,lambda作为一个表达式，定义了一个匿名函数，上例的代码x为入口参数，x+1为函数体。非常容易理解，在这里lambda简化了函数定义的书写形式。使得代码更为简洁，但是使用函数的定义方式更为直观，易理解。 Python中，也有几个定义好的全局函数方便使用的，filter, map, reduce：1234567&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = [2, 18, 9, 22, 17, 24, 8, 12, 27]&gt;&gt;&gt; print filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, foo)[18, 9, 24, 12, 27]&gt;&gt;&gt; print map(lambda x: x * 2 + 10, foo)[14, 46, 28, 54, 44, 58, 26, 34, 64]&gt;&gt;&gt; print reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, foo)139 _与__的区别 使用_one_underline来表示该方法或属性是私有的，不属于API； 当创建一个用于python调用或一些特殊情况时，使用two_underline； 使用__just_to_underlines，来避免子类的重写！ 原文地址:http://igorsobreira.com/2010/09/16/difference-between-one-underline-and-two-underlines-in-python.html “_”单下划线Python中不存在真正的私有方法。为了实现类似于c++中私有方法，可以在类的方法或属性前加一个“_”单下划线，意味着该方法或属性不应该去调用，它并不属于API。 “__”双下划线这个双下划线更会造成更多混乱，但它并不是用来标识一个方法或属性是私有的，真正作用是用来避免子类覆盖其内容。 看一个栗子： 123456789101112class A(object): def __method(self): print \"I'm a method in A\" def method(self): self.__method() a = A() a.method()## 输出：$ python example.py I'm a method in A 我们现在写一个类B，它继承了类A，并重新实现一个__method： 123456class B(A): def __method(self): print \"I'm a method in B\" b = B() b.method() 现在，结果是这样的： 12$ python example.pyI'm a method in A 就像我们看到的一样，B.method()不能调用B.method的方法。实际上，它是”“两个下划线的功能的正常显示。 因此，在我们创建一个以”__”两个下划线开始的方法时，这意味着这个方法不能被重写(override)，它只允许在该类的内部中使用。 在Python中如是做的？很简单，它只是把方法重命名了，如下：1234a = A()a._A__method() # never use this!! please!$ python example.py I'm a method in A 如果你试图调用a.method，它还是无法运行的，就如上面所说，只可以在类的内部调用method。 “xx“前后各双下划线当你看到”this“的时，就知道不要调用它。为什么？因为它的意思是它是用于Python调用的，如下：123456&gt;&gt;&gt; name = \"igor\" &gt;&gt;&gt; name.__len__() 4 &gt;&gt;&gt; len(name) 4 &gt;&gt;&gt; number = 10 &gt;&gt;&gt; number.__add__(20) 30 &gt;&gt;&gt; number + 20 30 “xx”经常是操作符或本地函数调用的magic methods。在上面的例子中，提供了一种重写类的操作符的功能。 在特殊的情况下，它只是python调用的hook。例如，init()函数是当对象被创建初始化时调用的;new()是用来创建实例。 1234567891011121314class CrazyNumber(object): def __init__(self, n): self.n = n def __add__(self, other): return self.n - other def __sub__(self, other): return self.n + other def __str__(self): return str(self.n) num = CrazyNumber(10) print num # 10print num + 5 # 5print num - 20 # 30 range和xrange的区别range 函数说明：range([start,] stop[, step])，根据start与stop指定的范围以及step设定的步长，生成一个list。range示例:123456&gt;&gt;&gt; range(5) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] &gt;&gt;&gt; range(1,5) [1, 2, 3, 4] &gt;&gt;&gt; range(0,6,2)[0, 2, 4] xrange 函数说明：用法与range完全相同，所不同的是生成的不是一个数组，而是一个generator。xrange示例:123456789101112&gt;&gt;&gt; xrange(5)xrange(5)&gt;&gt;&gt; list(xrange(5))[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]&gt;&gt;&gt; xrange(1,5)xrange(1, 5)&gt;&gt;&gt; list(xrange(1,5))[1, 2, 3, 4]&gt;&gt;&gt; xrange(0,6,2)xrange(0, 6, 2)&gt;&gt;&gt; list(xrange(0,6,2))[0, 2, 4] 由上面的示例可以知道：要生成很大的数字序列的时候，用xrange会比range性能优很多，因为不需要一上来就开辟一块很大的内存空间，这两个基本上都是在循环的时候用： 1234for i in range(0, 100): print i for i in xrange(0, 100): print i 这两个输出的结果都是一样的，实际上有很多不同，range会直接生成一个list对象：1234a = range(0,100) print type(a) print a print a[0], a[1] 输出结果：123&lt;type 'list'&gt;[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]0 1 而xrange则不会直接生成一个list，而是每次调用返回其中的一个值：1234a = xrange(0,100) print type(a) print a print a[0], a[1] 输出结果：123&lt;type 'xrange'&gt;xrange(100)0 1 所以xrange做循环的性能比range好，尤其是返回很大的时候，尽量用xrange吧，除非你是要返回一个列表。 for循环中的_一段代码:12for _ in xrange(10): block 如果循环中block不需要用到迭代值的话，我们可以不用给迭代值命名，用_就好。 if-else语句的简单赋值示例:1a = 20 if b == 2 else 3 #如果b==2,则a被赋值为20，否则被赋值为3 很多其他语言，如C++, Java都有这种赋值语句:1a = b==2? 20:3

卷积我们在 2 维上说话。有两个$\\mathcal{R}^2\\rightarrow \\mathcal{R}$的函数 f(x, y) 和 g(x, y) 。所谓 f 和 g 的卷积就是一个新的 $\\mathcal{R}^2\\rightarrow \\mathcal{R}$的函数 c(x, y) 。通过下式得到： 这式子的含义是：遍览从负无穷到正无穷的全部 s 和 t 值，把 g 在 (x-s, y-t) 上的值乘以 f 在 (s, t) 上的值之后再“加和”到一起（积分意义上），得到 c 在 (x, y) 上的值。说白了卷积就是一种“加权求和”，f 为权。以 (x, y) 为中心，把 g 距离中心 (-s, -t) 位置上的值乘上 f 在 (s, t) 的值，最后加到一起。把卷积公式写成离散形式就更清楚了： 第二个等号成立是因为在这里我们每隔单位长度 1 一采样，$\\Delta s$和$\\Delta t$都是 1 。可以令 G 表示一幅 100 x 100 大小的灰度图像。G(x, y) 取值 [0,255] 区间内的整数，是图像在 (x, y) 的灰度值。x 和 y 坐标取 [0, 99] ，其它位置上 G 值全取 0 。令 F 在 s 和 t 取 {-1, 0, 1} 的位置为特定值，其他位置全取 0 。F 可以看作是一个 3 x 3 的网格。如图 1.1 图 1.1 图 1.1 中 G 每个小格子里的值就是图像在 (x, y) 的灰度值。F 每个小格子里的值就是 F 在 (s, t) 的取值。 图 1.2 如图 1.2 所示，将 F 的中心 (0, 0) 对准 G 的 (6, 6) 。把 F 和 G 对应的 9 个位置上各自的值相乘，再将 9 个乘积加在一起，就得到了卷积值 C(6, 6) 。对 G 的每一个位置求 C 值，就得到了一幅新的图像。其中注意三点： F 是上下左右翻转后再与 G 对准的。因为卷积公式中 F(s, t) 乘上的是 G(x-s, y-t) 。比如 F(-1, -1) 乘上的是 G(7, 7) ；如果 F 的所有值之和不等于 1.0，则 C 值有可能不落在 [0, 255] 区间内，那就不是一个合法的图像灰度值。所以如果需要让结果是一幅图像，就得将 F 归一化——令它的所有位置之和等于 1.0 ；对于 G 边缘上的点，有可能它的周围位置超出了图像边缘。此时可以把图像边缘之外的值当做 0 。或者只计算其周围都不超边缘的点的 C 。这样计算出来的图像就比原图像小一些。在上例中是小了一圈，如果 F 覆盖范围更大，那么小的圈数更多。上述操作其实就是对数字图像进行离散卷积操作，又叫滤波。F 称作卷积核或滤波器。不同的滤波器起不同的作用。想象一下，如果 F 的大小是 3 x 3 ，每个格子里的值都是 1/9 。那么滤波就相当于对原图像每一个点计算它周围 3 x 3 范围内 9 个图像点的灰度平均值。这应该是一种模糊。看看效果。 图 1.3 左图是 lena 灰度原图。中图用 3 x 3 值都为 1/9 的滤波器去滤，得到一个轻微模糊的图像。模糊程度不高是因为滤波器覆盖范围小。右图选取了 9 x 9 值为 1/81 的滤波器，模糊效果就较明显了。滤波器还有许多其他用处。例如下面这个滤波器： +—+—+—+| -1 | 0 | 1 |+—+—+—+| -2 | 0 | 2 |+—+—+—+| -1 | 0 | 1 |+—+—+—+注意该滤波器没有归一化（和不是 1.0 ），故滤出来的值可能不在 [0, 255] 之内。通过减去最小值、除以最大／最小值之差、再乘以 255 并取整，把结果值归一到 [0, 255] 之内，使之成为一幅灰度图像。现在尝试用它来滤 lena 图。 图 1.4 该滤波器把图像的边缘检测出来了。它就是 Sobel 算子。边缘检测、图像模糊等等都是人们设计出来的、有专门用途的滤波器。如果搞一个 9 x 9 的随机滤波器，会是什么效果呢？ 图 1.5 如上图，效果也类似于模糊。因为把一个像素点的值用它周围 9 x 9 范围的值随机加权求和，相当于“捣浆糊”。但可以看出模糊得并不润滑。 这时我们不禁要想，如果不是由人来设计一个滤波器，而是从一个随机滤波器开始，根据某种目标、用某种方法去逐渐调整它，直到它接近我们想要的样子，可行么？这就是卷积神经网络（Convolutional Neural Network, CNN）的思想了。可调整的滤波器是 CNN 的“卷积”那部分；如何调整滤波器则是 CNN 的“神经网络”那部分。 卷积神经网络现在把卷积滤波器和神经网络两个思想结合起来。卷积滤波器无非就是一套权值。而神经网络也可以有（除全连接外的）其它拓扑结构。可以构造如图 3.1 所示意的神经网络。 图 3.1 该神经网络接受 n x n 个输入，产生 n x n 个输出。图中左边的平面包含 n x n 个格子，每个格子中是一个 [0, 255] 的整数值。它就是输入图像，也是这个神经网络的输入。右边的平面也是 n x n 个格子，每个格子是一个神经元。每个神经元连接到输入上它对应位置周围 3 x 3 范围内的值。每个连接有一个权值。所有神经元都如此连接（图中只画了一个，出了输入图像边缘的连接就认为连接到常数 0 ）。右边层的 n x n 个神经元的输出就是该神经网络的输出。 这个神经网络有两点与全连接神经网络不同。首先它不是全连接的。右层的神经元并非连接上全部输入，而是只连接了一部分。这里的一部分就是输入图像的一个局部区域。我们常听说 CNN 能够把握图像局部特征就是这个意思。这样一来权值少了很多，因为连接就少了。权值其实还更少，因为每一个神经元的 9 个权值都是和其他神经元共享的。全部 n x n 个神经元都用这共同的一组 9 个权值，并且不要偏置值。那么这个神经网络其实一共只有 9 个参数需要调整。 看了第一节的同学们都看出来了，这个神经网络不就是一个卷积滤波器么？只不过卷积核的参数未定，需要我们去训练——它是一个“可训练滤波器”。这个神经网络其实就是一个只有一个卷积层、且该卷积层只有一个滤波器（通道）的 CNN 。 试着用 Sobel 算子滤出来的图片作为目标值去训练这个神经网络。给神经网络的输入是灰度 lena 图，目标输出是经过 Sobel 算子滤波的 lena 图，见图 1.4 。这唯一的一对输入输出图片就构成了训练集。神经网络权值随机初始化，训练 2000 轮。如图 3.7 。 图 3.2 从左上到右下依次为：初始随机滤波器输出、每个 200 轮训练后的滤波器输出（ 10 幅）、最后一幅是 Sobel 算子的输出，也就是用作训练的目标图像。可以看到经过最初 200 轮后，神经网络的输出就已经和 Sobel 算子的输出看不出什么差别了。后面那些轮的输出基本一样。输入与输出的均方误差 mse 随着训练轮次的变化。如图 3.3 。 图 3.3 1500 轮过后，mse 基本就是 0 了。训练完成后网络的权值是： +——————-+——————–+——————–+| 1.2886529 | 0.04068733 | -1.3082279 |+——————-+——————–+——————–+| 1.43157125 | 0.01173212 | -1.45389295 |+——————-+——————–+——————–+| 1.34158182 | -0.07245208 | -1.27504027 |+——————-+——————–+——————–+与 Sobel 算子比较一下： +—+—+—+| -1 | 0 | 1 |+—+—+—+| -2 | 0 | 2 |+—+—+—+| -1 | 0 | 1 |+—+—+—+ 注意训练出来的滤波器负数列在右侧而不是左侧。因为计算卷积是把滤波器上下左右翻转反着扣上去的。这并不重要，本质是相同的。关键是一正列、一负列，中间零值列。非零值列三个值之比近似 1:2:1 。我们得到的就是一个近似的 Sobel 算子。我们以训练神经网络的方式把一个随机滤波器训练成了 Sobel 算子。这就是优化的魔力（代码见本文最后）。 在 CNN 中，这样的滤波器层叫做卷积层。一个卷积层可以有多个滤波器，每一个叫做一个通道，或者叫做一个 feature map 。可以给卷积层的输出施加某个激活函数：Sigmoid 、Tanh 等等。激活函数也构成 CNN 的一层——激活层，这样的层没有可训练的参数。 还有一种层叫做 Pooling 层（池化层）。它也没有参数，起到降维的作用。将输入切分成不重叠的一些 n x n 区域。每一个区域就包含 n x n 个值。从这 n x n 个值计算出一个值。计算方法可以是求平均、取最大等等。假设 n = 2，那么 4 个输入变成一个输出。输出图像就是输入图像的 1/4 大小。若把 2 维的层展平成一维向量，后面可再连接一个全连接前向神经网络。 通过把这些组件进行组合就得到了一个 CNN 。它直接以原始图像为输入，以最终的回归或分类问题的结论为输出，内部兼有滤波图像处理和函数拟合，所有参数放在一起训练。这就是卷积神经网络。 以上提供了一个理解 CNN 的视角。CNN 的发明并非沿着此思路。像 NN 本身一样，CNN 的思想来源于对生物视觉神经系统的研究。 Reference［1］《最优化导论》（美）Edwin K.

Computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation include low-level device control, error detection and correction algorithms, data compression, encryption algorithms, and optimization. For most other tasks, modern programming languages allow the programmer to work directly with abstractions instead of bits that represent those abstractions. Source code that does bit manipulation makes use of the bitwise operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and bit shifts. Bit manipulation, in some cases, can obviate or reduce the need to loop over a data structure and can give many-fold speed ups, as bit manipulations are processed in parallel, but the code can become more difficult to write and maintain. DETAILSBasicsAt the heart of bit manipulation are the bit-wise operators &amp; (and), | (or), ~ (not) and ^ (exclusive-or, xor) and shift operators a &lt;&lt; b and a &gt;&gt; b. There is no boolean operator counterpart to bitwise exclusive-or, but there is a simple explanation. The exclusive-or operation takes two inputs and returns a 1 if either one or the other of the inputs is a 1, but not if both are. That is, if both inputs are 1 or both inputs are 0, it returns 0. Bitwise exclusive-or, with the operator of a caret, ^, performs the exclusive-or operation on each pair of bits. Exclusive-or is commonly abbreviated XOR.

Some villain comes and places more balls on the table, it kind of works but one of the balls is on the wrong side and there is probably a better place to put the stick now. SVMs try to put the stick in the best possible place by having as big a gap on either side of the stick as possible. Now when the villain returns the stick is still in a pretty good spot. There is another trick in the SVM toolbox that is even more important. Say the villain has seen how good you are with a stick so he gives you a new challenge. There’s no stick in the world that will let you split those balls well, so what do you do? You flip the table of course! Throwing the balls into the air. Then, with your pro ninja skills, you grab a sheet of paper and slip it between the balls. Now, looking at the balls from where the villain is standing, they balls will look split by some curvy line.

This guide will take you through the steps to install and configure Git and connect it to remote repositories to clone, push, and pull. Choosing a Git distributionThere are two competing Git packages for Windows: a Cygwin-based Git and a version called msysGit. I will describe how to install the msysGit package. I recommend installing msysGit because I’ve found it’s easier to work with than the Cygwin based installation. Installing GitOnce you have downloaded the msysGit executable, double click on it to start the installation wizard. Leave the default directory options. When you get to the “Adjusting your Path environment” setting, select the “Run Git from the Windows Command Prompt” option. Choosing this option will make it easy for you to run Git commands from the Windows Command Prompt (command line) if you choose. Command Prompt is a simple tool, where you can run commands, switch through folders, manage files and it can be ran by selecting RUN… in START menu, and executing cmdcommand. Note : I recommend that you better choose the default options when installing msysGit for saving your time and mind. You will notice that for the rest of this article we will use Git Bash for running Git commands. The Git Bash tool works in the same way as the default Windows’ Command Prompt, but has some special features. With Git Bash you’ll be able to use a number of UNIX command line tools along with access to Git, and we recommend it since it’s often simpler to use than the Windows Command Prompt. You can run it by right clicking your mouse on the desktop, and selecting Git Bash from pop up window. Important note : The most common problems when setting up Git on Windows are related to SSH keys. Git uses SSH keys to securely access your repositories, and in Windows SSH keys are often searched on the wrong path when you try to use Git. If you use an older version of msysGit, you may encounter a step called “Choosing the SSH executables”. If you encounter that dialog, we recommend that you choose the “Use OpenSSH” option. After you have successfully installed Git on Windows, you’ll need to provide secure communication with your Git repositories by creating and installing SSH keys. Installing SSH keys on WindowsTo access your Git repositories you will need to create and install SSH keys. You can do this using OpenSSH and generate SSH keys with ssh-keygen Using OpenSSH and generating SSH keys with ssh-keygenTo communicate with the remote Git repository from your Windows computer, you will need to generate an SSH key pair for that computer. This process requires only a few steps, but you do first need to install msysGit using the full installer as described above. Generating a key pairTo do this you need to run Git Bash, which can be found in your START menu. Run the command: 1ssh-keygen -t rsa -C youremail@xxx.xxx Next, there will be several messages that asks you to set pass phrase. You could keep entering return key to skip these askings. Now that the keys are generated, open the file id_rsa.pub (found in the default location from the previous step) with a text editor. The contents of this file is your new public key. If you copy it to your clipboard, you can add it to your git SSH keys.

爬的对象 – 新浪爱问选择新浪爱问作为爬虫对象的原因如下： 大神博客中虽然有对该网站爬的教程，但是因为网站改版了，大神的正则表达式代码失效，很多读者都在求代码。既然没人来做，那就我来做好了； 这个网站比较简单，不需要密码登录验证，不反爬虫。这对于我这么一个爬虫新手，是相当友好的练手对象。 爬的目标爱问某一个专题下所有问题，以及问题下的最佳答案（当然，有的问题也可能没有最佳答案） 实现我是用python实现的这个爬虫（人生苦短，我用python。实现起来真是高效到没朋友） 需要挖掘的部分 从上图可以看出，我必须要挖出来的有两部分：每一页的链接，每一页的所有问题。进一步延伸，在爬下每一页的某一个问题后，要进入该问题详情页面中将最佳答案的内容爬下来。 使用的库 urllib &amp; urllib2 – 这两个库是用来访问网页获得网页源码的，具体使用方法见最后的代码或者官方文档。 re &amp; bs4 – 这两个库用来解析网页源码，挖出我所需要的每一页的链接，每一页的所有问题 具体实现的几个重要函数一、获得网页源码 123456789101112#传入url，获取该页的代码def getPage(self,pageStr): try: url = self.baseURL + pageStr request = urllib2.Request(url) response = urllib2.urlopen(request) return response except urllib2.URLError, e: if hasattr(e,\"reason\"): print u\"连接新浪爱问失败,错误原因\",e.reason return None 上述代码中，baseURL是新浪爱问的基地址，需要初始化实例的过程中传入，pageStr是待访问页面的定位符。baseURL+pageStr即为页面最终的网址。我之所以这么做，是因为该网站下所有网页都是有一个相同的基地址baseURL，而不同的专题页面都有不同的定位符pageStr。 二、解析网页源码中的链接 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526def getContent(self): #获得起始页的源码 #page = self.getPage(self.startPage).read().decode(\"utf-8\") page = self.getPage(self.startPage).read() #pdb.set_trace() #获得1-100页的源码 for i in range(1,self.endNum): print (\"正在获得第%d页的源码...\" %(i)) self.file.write(\"第%d页的问题\\n\" %(i)) #解析当前页源码 soup = BeautifulSoup(page,\"lxml\") #获得当前页的地址 current = soup.find(\"a\", string=i) #获得当前页的问题 questions = soup.find_all('div', class_='question-title') #处理当前页的问题 print (\"正在处理第%d页的问题...\" %(i)) self.handleQuestions(questions) #处理完当前页，跳到下一页 page = self.getPage(current['href']).read() self.file.close() 我利用beautiful soup来帮助解析获得当前页的链接，这个需要观察网页源码的代码特征，才能利用beautiful soup完成这一工作。 三、解析网页源码中的问题内容以及可能的最佳答案 前面已经利用beautiful soup提取出网页中的问题，现在进入问题详情页面，利用正则表达式来提取出网页源码中的问题内容和可能的最佳答案。说具题外话虽然是匹配出来了，但是我觉着我对正则表达式的理解还是很浅，还是需要多练。 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031def handleQuestions(self,questions):

如果我们要同时开发多个应用程序，那这些应用程序都会共用一个Python，就是安装在系统的Python 3。如果应用A需要jinja 2.7，而应用B需要jinja 2.6怎么办？ 这种情况下，每个应用可能需要各自拥有一套“独立”的Python运行环境。virtualenv就是用来为一个应用创建一套“隔离”的Python运行环境。 首先，我们用pip安装virtualenv： 1$ pip3 install virtualenv 然后，假定我们要开发一个新的项目，需要一套独立的Python运行环境，可以这么做： 第一步，创建目录： 123Mac:~ michael$ mkdir myprojectMac:~ michael$ cd myproject/Mac:myproject michael$ 第二步，创建一个独立的Python运行环境，命名为venv： 123Mac:myproject michael$ virtualenv --no-site-packages venvUsing base prefix '/usr/local/.../Python.framework/Versions/3.4'New python executable in venv/bin/python3.4Also creating executable in venv/bin/pythonInstalling setuptools, pip, wheel...done. 命令virtualenv就可以创建一个独立的Python运行环境，我们还加上了参数--no-site-packages，这样，已经安装到系统Python环境中的所有第三方包都不会复制过来，这样，我们就得到了一个不带任何第三方包的“干净”的Python运行环境。 新建的Python环境被放到当前目录下的venv目录。有了venv这个Python环境，可以用source进入该环境： 12Mac:myproject michael$ source venv/bin/activate(venv)Mac:myproject michael$ 注意到命令提示符变了，有个(venv)前缀，表示当前环境是一个名为venv的Python环境。 下面正常安装各种第三方包，并运行python命令： 12345(venv)Mac:myproject michael$ pip install jinja2...Successfully installed jinja2-2.7.3 markupsafe-0.23(venv)Mac:myproject michael$ python myapp.py... 在venv环境下，用pip安装的包都被安装到venv这个环境下，系统Python环境不受任何影响。也就是说，venv环境是专门针对myproject这个应用创建的。 退出当前的venv环境，使用deactivate命令： 12(venv)Mac:myproject michael$ deactivate Mac:myproject michael$ 此时就回到了正常的环境，现在pip或python均是在系统Python环境下执行。 完全可以针对每个应用创建独立的Python运行环境，这样就可以对每个应用的Python环境进行隔离。 virtualenv是如何创建“独立”的Python运行环境的呢？原理很简单，就是把系统Python复制一份到virtualenv的环境，用命令source venv/bin/activate进入一个virtualenv环境时，virtualenv会修改相关环境变量，让命令python和pip均指向当前的virtualenv环境。 小结virtualenv为应用提供了隔离的Python运行环境，解决了不同应用间多版本的冲突问题。","tags":[{"name":"Python","slug":"Python","permalink":"https://xijunlee.github.io/tags/Python/"},{"name":"Virtual

的作用就是打印（print）出第二列的内容。根据常规篇，可以知道ps输出的第二列正好是PID。就把进程相应的PID通过xargs传递给kill作参数，杀掉对应的进程。 改进７：难道每次都要调用xargs把PID传递给kill？答案是否定的： 1$kill -s 9 `ps -aux | grep firefox | awk '&#123;print $2&#125;'` 改进８：没错，命令依然有点长，换成pgrep。 1$kill -s 9 `pgrep firefox` 改进9——pkill：看到pkill想到了什么？没错pgrep和kill！pkill＝pgrep+kill。 1$pkill -９ firefox 说明：”-9” 即发送的信号是9，pkill与kill在这点的差别是：pkill无须 “ｓ”，终止信号等级直接跟在 “-“ 后面。之前我一直以为是 “-s 9”，结果每次运行都无法终止进程。 改进10——killall：killall和pkill是相似的,不过如果给出的进程名不完整，killall会报错。pkill或者pgrep只要给出进程名的一部分就可以终止进程。 1$killall -9 firefox","tags":[{"name":"Linux","slug":"Linux","permalink":"https://xijunlee.github.io/tags/Linux/"}]},{"title":"又从octopress迁移到hexo了……","date":"2017-01-15T08:59:32.000Z","path":"2017/01/15/又从octopress迁移到hexo了……/","text":"之前说好的迁移到octopress后就再也不折腾了，才不到一个月，又被打脸了。这次迁移的目的主要是octopress中的一些bug实在是fix不了（本来就不熟悉前端，也不喜欢写前端）。于是，在上次心动后花了一个下午来把整个博客迁移到hexo框架下。hexo较之octopress更新，而后者现在已经没人维护了，并且hexo是台湾人写的，有大量国人在维护和设计主题，对中文的支持更好。推荐以后想入坑（并且不熟悉前端的），就直接上hexo吧。 已解决的问题目前，在hexo框架下，已经fix的bug有： 日志分享 翻页功能 仍存在的问题 但是mathjax的公式渲染还是有些问题，不知道是不是文档中公式太多问题造成的。留待日后慢慢解决。 关于主题和界面首先，我对前端那一套不熟也不感兴趣。其次，我写博客的目的就是想总结学习知识的思路以及记录些生活琐事。基于以上两点，我不想花太多时间自己diy主题。找了一堆主题试，最后还是采用了yilia这个主题，主要是其提供的功能很健全（比如分享，评论等），并且也比较符合我的审美（但是我最想要的还是一款全黑的）。 希望以后坚持下来！ 以上","tags":[{"name":"Dairy","slug":"Dairy","permalink":"https://xijunlee.github.io/tags/Dairy/"}]},{"title":"常见拍卖机制与模型总结","date":"2017-01-03T08:33:34.000Z","path":"2017/01/03/2017-01-03-chang-jian-pai-mai-ji-zhi-yu-mo-xing-zong-jie/","text":"写在前面的话最近在为下一篇论文做背景知识的调研，两周以来都在读auction的基本理论和概念，本篇就用来总结一下常见的拍卖机制和模型。关于拍卖的理论研究着实复杂，本文只是做一个简单的总结，不涉及过多的数学证明及讨论。 四种基本的拍卖机制增加拍卖（英国式）为简单起见，先考虑拍卖一件物品。在增价拍卖机制下，价格不断上升，直到只剩下一个竞标者为止。一般是由专业拍卖人员叫价，竞标者举手应价，因此也被称为无声拍卖;也可以由竞标 者自己口头提出愿意接受的价格，这叫做有声拍卖;或是大家通过个人电脑输入价格(历史报价都是公开的)。这是用得最多的一种拍卖机制，特别是专业拍卖行均采用这种方式。世界上最古老，最大的两家专业拍卖行，索士比(Sotheby’s)和克里斯蒂(Christie’s)，都起源于英国伦敦，因此，这种增价拍卖方式常被称为英国式拍卖。 减价拍卖（荷兰式）减价拍卖刚好相反，卖家首先从很高的价格开始叫卖，如果没有人愿意出价，卖家由此价格按照事先规定的速度连续减价，直到有第一个人站出来接受卖家的报价。那么该该买家获得拍品。虽然是减价叫卖，但仍然是价高者得。在荷兰，人们常用这种机制来拍卖鲜花，因此称之为荷兰式叫卖。 第一价格拍卖每个竞标者在规定时间内，独立地向拍卖人提交标书，标明自己愿意出的价格，因此看不到其他竞标者的出价，再由拍卖人在约定的时间，邀请所有竞标者到场当众开标，出价最高者赢得物品，并付他自己的报价，因此第一价格拍卖也被称为高价拍卖，亦称招标拍卖或邮递拍卖。 第二价格拍卖与第一价格拍卖类似，在第二价格拍卖机制下，拍品仍然是归报价最高者，但成交价等于各买家中出的第二高报价。此方式在实际中用得不多，但有很好的理论性质。这一机制最先由经济学家维克瑞(William Vickrey)在1961年提出。 在每一种拍卖中，如出现几个人同时报得最高价，那么卖家就会在他们中随机挑选一个人作为赢家。此外，卖家通常还会增加两种限制。一种设定保留价（底价），另一种是收取参加拍卖的费用。在第一价格或第二价格拍卖机制下，竞标者的出价必须高于或等于保留价，否则不能成交。值得注意的是，在第二价格拍卖中，如果只有一个竞标者出价，而且高于保留价，那么他赢得并且支付保留价即可。在增价和减价拍卖中，保留价有着同样的作用。卖方在拍卖开始之前公开保留价，或者密封保留价。此外，卖方通常会要求感兴趣参加竞标的买方支付一定的费用才可以参与竞标。 三种拍卖的基本经济模型独立私有价值模型假设此时有一个卖家，他想卖掉一件物品，他对此物品的估价为$v_0$,这是公开的信息。有$n$个买方对此物品感兴趣，让$v_i$表示第i个买家对该物品的估价。现在作如下假定： 1.(私有价值)：对买方$i$来说，只有他自己知道$v_i$的大小，卖方及其他卖方不知道$v_i$的大小。但是他们会认为$v_i$是分布在$[a,z]$区间上的一个随机变量，并知道其概率分布函数$F_i(v_i)$和密度函数$f_i(v_i)$，其中$0 \\leq a &lt; z$。 2.(独立性)：总体来说，买家们的估价$v_1,v_2,…,v_n$是独立的。即它们的联合分布函数为: $$F(v_1,v_2,…,v_n)=F_1(v_1)F_2(V_2)…F_n(v_n)$$ 3.(对称性)：这些概率分布函数完全相同，即$\\forall i,j=1,2,…,n$和$\\forall v\\in[a,z]$: $$F_i(v)=F_j(v)=F(v)$$ 4.(风险中性)：每个买方的目标是最大化他的期望收益。 5.(非合作行为)：所有买方独立决定自己的竞价策略，不存在任何具有约束力的合作性协议。 所有这些假定中描述的知识，对买卖双方均属共同知识(common knowledge)。比如说，对于任意一个买家$i$，其他人猜测i的估价$v_i$是分布在$[a,z]$区间上的随机变量，并服从概率分布$F_i(v_i)$等等。对这种环境的描述称为对称独立私有价值(Symmetric Independent Private Value)模型，简称为SIPV模型。如果对称性假设不满足时，即各买家的估价分布函数不一致时，此时模型退化为更一般的独立私有价值(Independent Private Value)模型，简称为IPV模型。IPV模型描述了另外一种情况，即当每个买家对拍品有不同的偏好，而且不受别人偏好影响。 共同价值模型另一种极端情况可以用共同价值(Common Value)模型来描述，简称CV模型。对每个人来说，拍品都会有一个共同价值$v$，但卖家和买家都不知道$v$的大小，但他们每个人都有自己的估价$xi$。现作如下假定：共同价值$v$是一个服从概率分布$G(v)$和密度函数$g(v)$的随机变量，$v\\in [v{min},v_{max}]$。每个人的私人估价$x_i$服从$[a,z]$上的条件分布$H_i(x_i|v)$。 在最简单的情况下，我们可以将买家报价$x_i$表示成： $$ x_i=v+\\varepsilon_i $$ 其中$\\varepsilon_i$表示第i个人估价过程中的误差，假定其平均误差为零。 关联价值模型上述两种模型是理想的极端情况，但在现实生活中往往不会出现。有一种更具一般性的模型，能更适当地描述拍卖时间中参与人所处的环境，称为关联价值(Affiliated Value)模型。 第i个买方对拍品的真实价值$v_i$可能取决于所有买方的私人信息$x=(x_1,x_2,…,x_n)$以及其他共同的不确定因素$s=(s_1,s_2,…,s_k)$: $$ v_i=u(s,xi,x{-i}) $$ 其中向量$x_{-i}$表示$(x_1,x_2,…,x_n)$中去掉$x_i$。随机变量$x$和$s$呈现某种关联性，而且每个竞标者的真实价值$v_i$随$(s,xi,x{-i})$中的任何一个变量的增加而增加。 比较而言，关联价值模型对现实更有指导意义，而独立价值模型和共同价值模型是其的特殊情况。","tags":[{"name":"Auction","slug":"Auction","permalink":"https://xijunlee.github.io/tags/Auction/"}]},{"title":"泊松分布与指数分布的重新理解","date":"2016-12-28T03:01:20.000Z","path":"2016/12/28/2016-12-28-bo-song-fen-bu-yu-zhi-shu-fen-bu-de-zhong-xin-li-jie/","text":"写在前面的话组会上有人提到了几种概率分布，当时我听到的感觉就是“啊，我每一个都听过，也学过，但是都忘记了细节😭”。于是，会后又跑去wiki了一番，回忆了以前概率课上学的东西。记得当时学概率分布时，有几种分布是真的无法理解（至少在当时的思维下，我感觉是没有理解的），而且做题时常常陷入一种局部思维，把几种分布搞混淆。过了一两年，重新来看以前学过的东西，发现顿时有了更深的理解（我也不知道为什么，可能这就是所谓的“书读百遍其义自见”，但是也不是读一百遍就一定能懂，我觉得当时我把概念背了很熟，但有些还是不能很好地理解。 所以，现在重新整理下以前似懂非懂或者没注意的概念。 随机变量如果说要举出在概率论中出现频次最高的术语，随机变量绝对是位列三甲的。但是一个出现频次这么高的术语，而且也是概率论这门课一上来老师就强调的概念，我对其的理解却是很肤浅的。 从初等概率论出发。 如果$X$指定概率空间$S$中每一个事件$e$都有一个实数$X(e)$，同时针对每一个实数$r$都有一个事件集合$A_r$与其相对应，其中$A_r={e:X(e)\\leq r}$，那么$X$被称为随机变量。 – wikipedia 从上面的定义可以看到，随机变量其实不是一个变量，而是一个函数，是将概率空间$S$中每一个事件$e$映射到一个实数$r$上的函数。如下图所示： 举个栗子随机投掷两个骰子，那么整个样本空间可以由36个元素组成： $$S={(i,j)|i=1,…,6;j=1,…,6}$$ 很明显这里可以构成多个随机变量。比如随机变量$X$（投掷后两个骰子的点数之和）或者$Y$（投掷后两个骰子的点数之差），随机变量$X$可以有11个整数值，而随机变量$Y$只有6个。 $$X(i,j):=i+j,x=2,3,…,12$$ $$Y(i,j):=|i-j|,y=0,1,2,3,4,5.$$ 从上面的这个例子可以看到，随机变量们将原样本空间中的事件映射到了整数空间。 下面就正式进入正题来讲下我对泊松分布和指数分布的重新理解。因为其他几个分布还比较简单易懂，而泊松分布和指数分布不好懂而且它们也相似，故单独挑这两个出来。 泊松分布 Poisson分布，是一种统计与概率论中常见的离散概率分布，由法国数学家Siméon-Denis Poisson在1838年发表。其适合于描述单位时间内随机事件发生的次数的概率分布。如某一服务设施在一定时间内受到的服务请求的次数，电话交换机接到呼叫的次数、汽车站台的候客人数、机器出现的故障数、自然灾害发生的次数、DNA序列的变异数、放射性原子核的衰变数、激光的光子数分布等等。 –wikipedia 泊松分布的概率质量函数： $$P(X=k)=\\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^k}{k!}$$ 泊松分布的参数$\\lambda$是单位时间（或单位面积）内随机事件的平均发生率。 在概率论中，概率质量函数（probability mass function，简写为pmf）是离散随机变量在各特定取值上的概率。概率质量函数和概率密度函数不同之处在于：概率质量函数是对离散随机变量定义的，本身代表该值的概率；概率密度函数是对连续随机变量定义的，本身不是概率，只有对连续随机变量的概率密度函数在某区间内进行积分后才是概率。 泊松分布的累积分布函数: $$P(X\\leq k)=e^{-\\lambda}\\sum_{i=0}^{k}\\frac{\\lambda_i}{i!}$$ 下面分别给出其概率质量函数和累积分布函数的图像： 对着上述图像解释，每个点的意义就是单位时间或面积内随机事件发生k次的概率。 对着上述图像解释，每个点的意义就是单位时间或面积内随机事件发生次数小于等于k次的概率。 指数分布泊松分布，我觉得相对来说还好理解一些。而指数分布就有点那么绕了，不过我觉得结合其概率密度函数图和累积分布函数图来看，就好理解一些了。 在概率论和统计学中，指数分配（Exponential distribution）是一种连续概率分布。指数分配可以用来表示独立随机事件发生的时间间隔，比如旅客进入机场的时间间隔、打进客服中心电话的时间间隔、中文维基百科新条目出现的时间间隔等等。 –wikipedia 首先注意到，与泊松分布相比，其最大的差异就是指数分布是针对连续随机变量定义，即时间这个变量。时间必须是连续的。而泊松分布是针对随机事件发生次数定义的，发生次数是离散的。粗略地可以认为这两个分布之间有一种“倒数”的关系。 指数函数的概率密度函数: $$p(x;\\lambda)=\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x},x \\in [0,+\\infty)$$ 其中，$\\lambda &gt; 0$是该分布的一个参数，称为率参数(rate parameter)。即每单位时间内发生该事件的次数。读到这里，可能因为这个率参数被搞得一头雾水，容易跟泊松分布混淆。 指数分布的累积分布函数： $$p(x;\\lambda)=1- e^{-\\lambda x},x \\in [0,+\\infty)$$ 估计还是一头雾水😓，下面结合指数分布的概率密度曲线和累积分布曲线图，就稍微能理解下了（至少我是这么认为： 上述第二幅图像正是指数分布的累积分布函数图，对着图来看能更好的理解指数分布。 1.先看$\\lambda=1.0$这条曲线。关注到这条曲线上横坐标为1的点，其意义是1个单位时间该事件发生1次的概率。如果是横坐标为2的点，则其意义便是2个单位时间内该事件发生1次的概率。换个方法说，就是第k次该事件发生后隔2个单位时间发生第k+1次该事件的概率。 2.再看$\\lambda=1.5$这条曲线。与上述描述类似，先关注到这曲线上横坐标为1的点，其意义是1个单位时间内该事件发生1.5次的概率（次数居然是1.5次？？？理论上确实可以这么说，只是不好理解，如果换成整数次就可能更好理解）。如果是横坐标为2的点，其意义便是2个单位时间内该事件发生1.5次的概率。同样地，换个说法，也就是第k次该事件发生后隔2个单位时间该事件发生第k+1.5次的概率。 我觉得通过上述对图的表述，能进一步加深对指数分布的理解了。 结论首先，这两个分布最大的不同是，泊松分布是针对随机事件发生次数的定义的离散随机变量，而指数分布是针对随机事件发生的间隔时间定义的连续随机变量，这是二者最大的区别。切莫因为参数$\\lambda$把二者混淆了。","tags":[{"name":"Probability Theory","slug":"Probability-Theory","permalink":"https://xijunlee.github.io/tags/Probability-Theory/"}]},{"title":"有逼格的画图从gnuplot说起","date":"2016-12-24T12:29:04.000Z","path":"2016/12/24/2016-12-24-you-bi-ge-de-hua-tu-cong-gnuplotshuo-qi/","text":"有写论文需求的伙伴们，画图的时候肯定会被导师吐槽过“你这图画的真难看……”。如果不是在写学术论文，Excel就能解决大部分需求。但是，如果想画出印刷出版物品质的插图，还是得用到额外的工具。最常见的无非是用Matlab来画论文插图。但是，我还是有点嫌弃Matlab做出图片的配色和线条粗细（当然，这个可以调整，但每个人审美确实不同）。如果想画出大部分人都觉得精致的插图，该用什么好呢？其实，我之前一段时间是用的Python的一个库matlibplot,挺方便也挺好看的。但是后来，拜读隔壁大牛实验室IPADS的paper时，总觉得他们的插图很有逼格。这么一打听，才知道是用gnuplot画的。于是，我最近的一篇论文就开始全部用gnuplot作图了。以后应该是全面倒向gnuplot的怀抱。 此篇文章就简单记录下我使用gnuplot的过程，以后边学边update。首先，什么是gnuplot？ Gnuplot is a portable command-line driven graphing utility for Linux, OS/2, MS Windows, OSX, VMS, and many other platforms. The source code is copyrighted but freely distributed (i.e., you don’t have to pay for it). It was originally created to allow scientists and students to visualize mathematical functions and data interactively, but has grown to support many non-interactive uses such as web scripting. It is also used as a plotting engine by third-party applications like Octave. Gnuplot has been supported and under active development since 1986. 简单了说gnuplot就是一款跨多平台的，支持交互式的，开源的脚本画图语言。如果之前有过Python或Matlab经验的话，gnuplot上手就更快了。下面，给出一些gnuplot画图的demo。 安装gnuplot支持多平台，因此安装也是多种多样的，具体参见其下载页面，应当是比较简单的，尤其是在Windows下，其安装就是一路点到底。 一个demo for Windows因为我论文是在实验室的台式机(Windows)上写的。所以，下面的例子就以Windows下的gnuplot来讲解。 在我论文中，有个需求就是，将折线图和柱状图画在一个坐标系中，二者共用一个横坐标，而左边的纵坐标为柱状图的度量单位，右边的纵坐标为折线图的度量单位，如下图所示: 那么，该如何画这样的图呢？ 1. 准备好你的数据集gnuplot支持从.txt,.csv等诸多文件中读取数据。我推荐的方式是用额外的文件保存数据，画图的脚本从该文件中读取数据来进行画图。在我的实践中，我是用.txt来保存数据的，如下所示： 123456789101112131415161718letter.txt1 2.978431 35.85 35.95 35.32 5.886818 35.95 36.55 34.93 7.494 38.9 39.85 36.454 8.354836 39.5 41.65 36.25 9.533521 41.9 44.95 36.656 10.488704 46 48.1 38.957 10.809368 52.9 56.55 42.78 10.902275 59.75 66.9 479 10.927407 67.95 75.05 50.9510 10.933407 72.05 80.1 51.4511 10.936407 75.25 82.8 54.712 10.940407 78.65 84.7 56.6513 10.940407 82 89.45 59.3514 10.942407 83.5 89.45 64.715 10.942407 88 93.5 69.716 10.942407 86.65 95.35 69.75 其中，第一列是横坐标数，第二列是Entropy，第三到第五列是三个分类器的分类正确率。 2. 一个脚本demo我觉得学习写代码最快的方式就是直接读别人的代码，懂了后，然后就根据自己的需求改。那么下面，我就直接上绘图脚本的代码。 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354set size ratio 0.8%设置输出图像的长宽比为0.8aqua = \"#00FFFF\";

写在括号里的话：（其实这是我本科毕设的内容，当时做了两个月，觉得还比较有意思。花两三个月做毕设是有点多余的，期间很是拖沓。我觉得这个课题还是蛮有趣的，和实际应用联系得很紧密，所以我就来安利一下子空间聚类算法 (￣︶￣) 1.什么是高维数据？高维数据，顾名思义就是维数很高的数据（废话），像图像、视频这些最常见的数据就是高维数据，它们的维数至少都是上百维的。这么说不直观，我们来看下实际研究中是如何处理一张图像数据的。 图像是由不同的色彩构成的，我们可以将像素理解为图像的最小单位，像素是一个值，用来控制这么一个最小单位的色彩。最简单的图像就是灰度图，其实也就是黑白图片。不过黑色也分等级，比如白色可以理解为最浅的黑色，故白色定义为0，黑色的定义为255，其余不同程度的灰色介于0~255之间。 举个栗子，一张10*10的灰度图像就是长10个像素，宽10个像素，共100个像素构成的图像，每个像素值是在0~255之间。因此，一张图片实际等价于一个矩阵，如下图所示： 但是，现实生活中更为常见的是彩色图像。彩色图像相比灰度图要复杂些，其每个像素由R、G、B分量构成的图像，其中R、G、B是由不同的灰度级来描述的。以下公式能将一个彩色像素转换为灰度像素： 浮点算法：$Gray=R0.3+G0.59+B*0.11$； 整数方法：$Gray=(R30+G59+B*11)/100$； 移位方法：$Gray=(R76+G151+B*28)&gt;&gt;8$； 平均值法：$Gray=(R+G+B)/3$； 仅取绿色：$Gray=G$ 在实际应用中，我们的确是先把采集到的彩色图片转换成灰度图，得到灰度图的像素矩阵： 得到了像素矩阵后，我们才能开始一系列的数据处理任务。 前面那一节写了一大堆，只是为了描述我们实际应用中真正处理的数据对象长啥样。得到一副图像的灰度矩阵后，我们一般还会把这个矩阵拉成一个向量，即将矩阵的每一列接起来形成一个向量，我们称这样的向量是一个样本。 2.聚类 “将物理或抽象对象的集合分成由类似的对象组成的多个类的过程被称为聚类。” –wikipedia 举个栗子，如下图，共有三个人，每个人5张，总共15张正脸图像，聚类的目的是根据这些照片中的特征，将特征相似的图片聚到一起: 将上述15张图片正确地聚成三类，是聚类的终极目的： 一般地，我们将一张图片视为一个向量，具体的转换方法在第一节中有描述。聚类，用数学语言描述如下： 给定一个n个样本构成的矩阵$X=[x_1,x_2,…,x_n] \\in R^{m*n},x_i\\in R^m$，并且已知这n个样本是分别来自k个类别。聚类的目的是将这n个样本正确地划归到各自所述类别中去。 解决聚类问题的算法有很多：系统聚类法、有序样品聚类法，动态聚类法、K均值聚类法。我来安利一下K均值聚类算法好了。 2.1K均值聚类算法为简单起见，我就又举个栗子来说明这个算法吧。 如上图所示，总共有A,B,C,D,E五个样本，要将其聚成k=2类。其中，灰色点是类中心。K均值算法的流程如下： 1）类中心初始化。这里可以直接取任意k个样本作为初始类中心${C_i}(i=1,..,k)$，也可以随意取这些样本之外的k个点作为类中心${C_i}$； 2）计算每一个样本Pi到k个类中心${C_i}$的距离，将样本Pi划到与其距离最近的类中心${C_j}$所在的类中去，即若${C_j}$是到${P_i}$最近的类中心，则将${P_i}$归到第j类中去； 3）更新类中心。根据第2）步的聚类结果，计算新的类中心，较直接的方法是取该类中所有样本各坐标的均值作为新类中心的各坐标值。 4）重复步骤2），3），直到k个类中心不再发生变化，即得到最后的聚类结果； 步骤3）中是最简单的更新类中心的方法，但还有其他的求类中心的方法： 1、Minkowski Distance公式——λ可以随意取值： $$d{ij}=\\lambda\\sqrt{\\sum{k=1}^{n}|x{ik}-x{jk}|^\\lambda}$$ 2、Euclidean Distance公式——第一个公式λ=2的情况： $$d{ij}=\\sqrt{\\sum{k=1}^{n}(x{ik}-x{jk})^2}$$ 3、CityBlock Distance公式——第一个公式λ=1的情况： $$d{ij}=\\sum{k=1}^n|x{ik}-x{jk}|$$ 好了，以上就是对于聚类问题以及传统聚类算法的一个简单介绍，下一章中我将介绍针对高维数据聚类的子空间聚类算法。","tags":[{"name":"Clustering","slug":"Clustering","permalink":"https://xijunlee.github.io/tags/Clustering/"},{"name":"Machine

这本书的作者——杜兰特夫妇是大有来头的，两人花了50年的时间写成了11卷的《世界文明史》，但因为这套书卷帙浩繁，比较学术，所以二人于1968年出了这套巨作的精简版《历史的教训》，方便一般读者阅读。因为作者是活跃于20世纪的人，因此他们的部分观点是有点过时和不客观的，大家去读了就知道。 下面，偷个懒，我就直接摘取书中让我停下来思考过的段落： 1、“一个人，无论他是如何光彩夺目或者见识广博，在他的有生之年，也不可能无所不知，总是能对他所在社会的习惯和礼俗做出明智的判断与取舍。因为这些习惯和礼俗，是无数代人在许多个世纪的历史长河中形成的智慧与经验的结晶。一个荷尔蒙旺盛的青年或许会问，为什么他不能充分享有性欲发泄的自由？假如他不遵守习俗、道德与法律的规范，在他足够成熟之前，还不明白性是一条充满烈火的欲河，必须处处设防，严加限制，约束自己，那么将会导致个人和团体的大混乱，并毁掉自己的一生。” ——摘自第五章 性格与历史 我的思考：其实这段简而言之就是“不听老人言吃亏在眼前”，我们现在确实是处在血气方刚的年纪，觉得不叛逆、墨守成规就是一点没有年轻人的朝气。但是，我们是否想过前人的这些规矩和制度为什么会留下来。举个栗子，古文明时期存在过多种婚姻制度，但为什么现代社会唯独推崇一夫一妻制？因为这是最有利于经济稳定和财产继承的婚姻制度，因此它留下来了。人类社会也同样适用适者生存的规则，现代社会推崇的价值观和制度不是某某领导人的意志，也不是上帝的神谕，而是长期社会发展优胜劣汰下来的人类经验之谈。当然，也不是要求我们每个人都要墨守成规，反正我觉得经过时间和社会认可的规律和制度都是值得年轻人遵循的。 2、“即使是持怀疑论的历史学家也对宗教保持谦卑的尊重，因为他看到了宗教在每一块土地、每一个时代，都发挥着似乎不可或缺的作用，宗教让社会最底层的人有了存在的意义和尊严；通过宗教的一些仪式，人间习俗变成与上帝的神圣关系，从而形成稳定的力量。宗教使穷人不会再去谋害富人（拿破仑语）。因为人生而不平等，所以注定我们有许多人经受贫穷和失败，对于失意的人而言，某种不可思议的超自然希望是替代绝望的唯一选择。摧毁了希望，阶级斗争就会愈演愈烈。天堂和乌托邦，就像一个井中的两个水桶：当一个下降时，另一个就会升上来；当宗教衰退时，共产主义就会兴起。 在我们这个时代以前的历史中，还找不到一个显著的例子表明，在没有宗教的帮助下，一个社会的道德生活也能成功地维持。法国、美国和其他一些国家，已经是他们的政府脱离了教会，但是他们仍然需要宗教在维数社会秩序方面给予帮助。只有少数几个共产主义国家，不仅已经与宗教脱离关系，并且还拒绝其援助。或许，这个实验在俄罗斯取得了明显而暂时的成功，在很大程度上归功于人们暂时将共产主义当成了人民的宗教，它取代了教会，成为了安慰与希望的供应者。如果社会主义政权不能消灭民众的相对贫穷，这个新的宗教就将失去它的狂热和效果，国家也许就会默许恢复超自然的信仰，以此来缓和不满。“只要有贫穷，就会有神灵。” ’ ——摘自第七章 宗教与历史 我的思考：嘘…… 3、“财富集中是自然的和不可避免的，可以借助暴力的或者是和平的部分再分配而得到周期性的缓解。就此而论，所有的经济史都是这个社会有机体缓慢的心脏跳动，财富的集中和强制再分配，便是它巨大的收缩与扩张运动。 ” ——摘自第八章 经济与历史 4、“对资本主义的恐惧，迫使社会主义不断扩大自由；而对社会主义的恐惧，则迫使资本主义不断增加平等。东方就是西方，西方就是东方，这一对双胞胎很快就会团聚。” ——摘自第九章 社会主义与历史 我的思考：虽然我们总是喊着要平等，要自由，其实仔细想想这二者是根本就是对立的嘛。社会从来就是不公平的，最集中的体现就是财富不均，如果要求人人平等，那么富人的自由势必受到限制。如果要求人人自由，那么穷人和富人会因为财富的差异造成享受不平等的自由权利。当代每个国家的政府无不都是在二者之中找平衡，一旦失衡，管你什么主义都势将倒闭。 5、“由于财富是一种生产和交换的秩序和过程，而不是囤积货物；是一种个人或机构的信托，而不是纸币或支票的内在价值。因此，暴力革命对财富所做的再分配，并不会多过对财富的损坏。对土地可以进行再分配，但是人们之间的天然不平等，很快就会产生新的占有和特权的不平等，形成新的少数人权力，他们的本能从本质上说和过去的少数一样。唯一真正的革命，是对心灵的启蒙和个性的提升；唯一真正的解放，是个人的解放；唯一真正的革命者，是哲学家和圣人。 如果教育机会平等能够建立起来，民主政治将会是真实和公平的。因为这才是它的口号背后至关重要的真理：虽然人们不能做到生而平等，但是教育和机会的获得会让他们越来越接近平等。民权不是去从政和行使权力，而是他们有选择每一种生活方式的权力，这种选择也可以检验一个人是否合适做官或者执政。” ——摘自第十章 政府与历史 我的思考：正因为生而不平等，所以人类社会才需要教育来弥补这种不平等。但是当代社会，教育资源和机会的多少却越来越与财富的多少挂钩，这个现象是在全球范围都有的，这到底是人为的还是社会发展必须的呢？ 6、“战争或冲突是万物之父，是各种观念、发明、制度和国家强有力的来源。和平只是一种不稳定的平衡，只能靠公认的霸权或势力均衡来维持。 ………… 英国在十九世纪很好地履行了保护西方文明免受外来威胁的职责，美国今天必须接过这一职责。新兴国家渴望通过一次工业革命，来获得经济的繁荣与军事力量的壮大，他们对苏联在政府管制下迅速工业化的过程印象深刻。也许最终西方资本主义国家会有更高的生产力，但是发展速度似乎较慢；一些新的执政者热衷于控制他们国家的资源与命脉，很可能被共产主义的宣传等活动所俘获。” ——摘自第十一章 历史与战争 我的思考：这一段的内容是与我以往所受到的教育相违背的，其中关于战争与和平的阐述既让我耳目一新，也是我思考了之后所认同的，但是这段中后半部分的内容就见仁见智了。 7、“在一个社会中，因为经济的发展产生了不平等，就会分化成两个阶层，一个是少数的文化精英，一个是多数的芸芸众生，他们十分不幸，因为天生的原因或者环境的关系，无法继承或者发展出高贵典雅的水准。随着这个多数的增长，它会对少数的文化起到拖累作用；它的谈吐、服饰、娱乐、感情、价值判断会向上扩散，多数内部的野蛮化是少数控制教育和经济机会所要付出的代价之一。” ——摘自第十二章 增长与衰退 我的思考：举个栗子，古罗马人的文化与制度是如此的令人赞叹，他们的文化是精致和伟大的。但是这些东西全部都建立在他们对周边蛮族的残酷剥削和统治之上。罗马周边的蛮族被逐渐罗马化了，但是是更多蛮族的习俗影响了罗马人，到了罗马后期，其军队中竟有四分之三是外族人。到最后，相对落后的日耳曼人竟征服了罗马，还是令人扼腕。 8、“从历史的过程中，我们认为，人类的本性并没有发生实质性的改变，所有的技术成就，都不得不被看成是用新方法完成就目标——取得财货，追求异性（或者同性），在竞争中取胜，发动战争。” ——摘自第十三章 真有进步吗？ 写在最后：我觉得这本书的每一章都值得大书特书，都值得深思。我也从来不认为读历史类书籍就立马会给人以启发，或者带来现实生中的好处。读历史，尤其是这种总结性质的历史书，给了我们一个机会从宏观的角度观察人类社会的运作，这往往是我们大陆学生所欠缺的，所以推荐此书，与诸君共勉。","tags":[{"name":"Reading","slug":"Reading","permalink":"https://xijunlee.github.io/tags/Reading/"}]},{"title":"Blog

话不多说，我先直接给出算导上关于删除操作的伪代码（这伪代码几乎就可以当作实现代码了，不过还是要搞懂原理） 红黑树的删除操作删除操作伪代码123456789101112131415161718RB-DELETE(T,z) if left[z] == nil[T] || right[z] == nil[T] then y &lt;- z else y &lt;- TREE-SUCCESOR(z) if

then key[z] &lt;- key[y] copy y’s satellite data into z if color[y] == BLACK then RB-DELETE-FIXUP(T,z) 可以从上述伪代码发现，红黑树的删除操作和普通二叉树操作差不多，但因为红黑树的性质，当如果删除的节点是一个黑节点时，则有可能违反某些性质（用脚趾头想最可能违反的性质就是性质5）：某个节点到其叶子节点所有路径上的包含相同的黑节点数），那么就需要调用 RB-DELETE-FIXUP(T,z)来修正。为什么不要讨论删除的节点是红节点的情况呢？如果这棵树先前就是一棵标准的红黑树的话，那么它就满足所有的红黑性质，删除一个红色节点，是不会违反任何一条性质的。 下面先给出RB-DELETE-FIXUP(T,z)的伪代码 1234567891011121314151617181920212223RB-DELETE-FIXUP(T,z)的伪代码： while x != root[T] &amp;&amp; color[x] == BLACK do if x == left[p[x]] then w &lt;- right[p[x]] if color[w] == RED then color[w] &lt;- BLACK //case 1 color[p[x]] &lt;- RED //case 1 LEFT-ROTATE(T,p[x]) //case

color[right[w]] &lt;- BLACK //case 4 LEFT-ROTATE(T,p[x]) //case 4 x&lt;-root //case 4 else (same as then clause with “right” and “left” exchange) 可能初看这么一大堆伪代码，谁看谁都会头晕。先思考下删除一个黑节点会违反哪些性质呢？ * 如果y原来是根节点，那么y的一个红孩儿x可能成为新根，那么就违反了根节点必须是黑色的性质； * 如果x和p[y]都是红色的，那么删除了黑节点y后，那就违反了两个红节点不能相邻的性质； * 因为删除了一个黑色节点y，那么在包含节点y的路径上就少了一个黑节点，就违反了性质5） 算法导论书上fix上述可能违反的性质的基本思路其实也很简单：因为删除的是一个黑节点，其黑色的删除是一定会违反性质5）的，那么就假想被删结点y的儿子节点x具有一层额外的黑色，如果x原本是红节点的话，就把x节点染成黑色，如果x不是红节点的话，就沿着x往上升，找到一颗红节点并把它染成黑色；如果一直往上升，直到根节点都没有找到红节点的话，那就可以把这额外的黑色给“挤”出去。要完成上述两个想法，需要一定的旋转和颜色改变。下面来讨论具体的八种可能违反红黑性质的情况。 图1 删除操作的四种情况，其余四种是这四种的对偶 需要考虑的有八种情况，但是其中四种与另外四种是相互对称的，因此只需要详细讲其中四种的操作即可： x的兄弟w是红色的；处理方法：因为能进入到循环内，所以x一定是黑的。并且其兄弟w是红的，所以x的父亲一定是红的，于是将w与p[x]的颜色互换，然后对p[x]做左旋。x的兄弟w就变成节点D，是黑色的，于是将情况1转换成了情况2。 x的兄弟w是黑色的，并且w的两个儿子都是黑色的。处理方法：将w涂成红色的，并将x指向原来x的父亲节点。注意到，只有在这个情况下才会使得指针上升。 x的兄弟w是黑色的，但w的左孩子是红色的，w的右孩子是黑的。处理方法：将w与其左孩子颜色互换，然后对w做右旋，x的新兄弟变成节点C。这时，x的兄弟w变成黑色，而其右孩子变成了红色，将情况3转换成了情况4. x的兄弟w是黑色的，且w的右孩子是红色的。处理方法：这种情况是终极情况，只需要将p[x]和w的颜色互换，并将w的红孩儿染成黑色的，然后对p[x]做左旋，最后将x指向整棵树的根，即可退出while循环。 总结：因为删除的是一颗黑节点，黑节点的减少，势必会违背性质5。因此就要想方设法将这额外的黑色转嫁给树中某颗红节点。可以看到，情况1和情况3并没有在局部新增黑色的节点，这两种情况的作用只不过是将它们转化为情况2和情况4。而情况2是将x所在这一层的所有黑色减少一次，将这个黑色转接到其父亲那一层去。情况4则更简单，找到x兄弟w的一个红孩儿，把它染成黑色，就结束了这一路寻找红节点的旅程。

整个算法确实算比较复杂的，实现代码比普通二叉树多一倍多，但换来的是效率上的提升。废话不多说，总结一下学习心得（基本的细节不会提到，因为可以去翻书，我只写出对书中个别知识点的理解和总结），方便日后会看红黑树时，能立马回忆起来。 红黑树的性质 每个节点要么是红的， 要么是黑的； 根节点是黑的； 每个叶节点（NIL）是黑的； 如果一个节点是红的，那么它的两个儿子是黑的； 对每个节点，从该节点到其子孙节点的所有路径上包含数目相同的黑节点。 以上四条性质都很好理解，唯独就是第五条不好理解，我觉得是翻译的不好。如果不亲自去实现一遍这个算法，对第五条性质中的“子孙节点”的理解是会有歧义的。比如，我初次看到这条性质的时候，我将该节点的子孙节点理解成为该节点的儿子节点+孙子节点+曾孙子节点+……+叶节点，汉语中确实是这么个意思嘛，但实际上是指沿着该节点下去的能达到的所有叶子节点。 图1 一棵标准的红黑树 如图所示，这是一棵标准的红黑树。针对性质5），我们从图中根节点26出发，很容易验证到达其叶子节点nil[T]的所有路径中经过的黑节点数都是4（当然包括它本身）。再拿节点21做例子，从节点21出发到达叶子节点的所有路径中经过的黑节点数都是3。这才是性质5）想要表达的意思，因此，我将性质5）转述成了如下：性质5）对于每个节点，从该节点到叶子节点nil[T]的所有路径上包含相同数目的黑节点。有了对上述五条性质的正确理解，才能搞得懂后面那些操作算法，因为这些算法的正确性需要有这些性质做保证。 局部旋转 图2 旋转操作 旋转操作还是很简单的，所以不去赘述其细节，但在具体实现的时候要注意两点： 节点之间的连接关系的建立与删除最好是成对地去处理； 若旋转前的父节点x是整棵树的根节点，旋转之后，要记得将树的根节点置为y。 插入操作先给出算法导论书上的伪代码： 123456789101112131415161718RB-INSERT(T,z)伪代码 y &lt;- nil[T] x &lt;- root[T] while x != nil[T] y &lt;- x if key[x] &gt; key[z] then x &lt;- left[x] else x&lt;- right[x] p[z] &lt;- y if y == nil[T] then root[T] &lt;- z else if key[z] &lt; key[y] then left[y] &lt;- z else right[y] &lt;- z left[z] &lt;- nil[T] right[z] &lt;- nil[T] color[z] &lt;- RED RB-INSERT-FIXUP(T,z) 从上述伪代码可以看出，红黑树的插入操作与普通二叉树的插入操作的差别很小，我们可以注意到插入的新节点的颜色居然是红色，为什么是红色呢？其实很容易想得通，如果插入的新节点就是黑色的话，那么会改变某个节点的黑高度，因此违反了性质5），往往涉及到黑节点的处理都会比较复杂。因此算导选择插入的新节点一开始就将它设置为红色的，但这样子也可能违反性质2）、4），因此需要有一个辅助程序RB-INSERT-FIXUP来修补可能违反的性质。 RB-INSERT-FIXUP修补可能违反的性质4），z指向插入的红色节点，因为违反了性质4），所以p[z]也是红的。可以将违反性质4）的情况归结为三种（其实，不止三种，是六种，另外三种可以通过对称关系得到。） 1234567891011121314151617RB-INSERT-FIXUP(T,z)伪代码 while color[p[z]] == RED if p[z] == left[p[p[z]] then y &lt;- right[p[p[z]] if color[y] == RED //case1 then color[p[z]] &lt;- BLACK //case1 color[y] &lt;- BLACK //case1 color[p[p[z]] &lt;- RED //case1 z &lt;- p[p[z]] //case1 else if z

with “right” and “lefet” exchange) color[root[T]] &lt;- BLACK 图3 插入操作中可能遇到的三种情况 z的叔叔y是红色的。处理方法：很简单，将z的祖父染成红色，将其父亲和叔父染成黑色，这样就解决了z的红色与其父亲也是红色的冲突。（那么其祖父先前就会是黑色的吗？答案是一定的，因为z的父亲和叔叔都是红色的，而未加入红节点z之前该树是满足红黑性质的，因此z的祖父一定是黑色的，如果z的祖父也是红的话，那么就与z父亲是红色的冲突了。）z指向其原来祖父，这样指针沿着树上升了两层。并且所有情况中，只有情况1会使得指针z上升两层。 z的叔叔y是黑色的，z是其父亲的右孩子。处理方法：将z的父亲右旋即可，z指向原先z的父亲。经过旋转变换后，现在的z是其父亲的左儿子，并且它的叔叔是黑色的，那么情况2就转换为了情况3。 z的叔叔y是黑色的，z是其父亲的左孩子。处理方法：通过情况1或者情况2都可能进到情况3。因为在这个情况下，z及其父亲p[z]都是红色。故先将其父亲p[z]染成黑色，将其祖父p[p[z]]染成红色，然后对祖父节点p[p[z]]做右旋。 其余的三种情况与上述三种情况是相互对称的。上述三种情况的转化关系如下： 最后，值得注意的是退出while循环时，需要置根节点的颜色为黑色。因为while循环条件是z的父亲p[z]为红色的，当z指向树的根时，z的父亲是nil[T]为黑色，故会退出循环，但是z的颜色为红色，因此需要置其颜色为黑色，这样就不违反性质2）了。","tags":[{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","permalink":"https://xijunlee.github.io/tags/Algorithm/"}]},{"title":"算法导论学习之二叉查找树的删除操作","date":"2015-07-14T10:13:48.000Z","path":"2015/07/14/算法导论学习之二叉查找树的删除操作/","text":"写在前面的话虽然二叉树很简单，但是其中的删除操作还是有些麻烦的。看完算导关于本节的内容后，动手实现了一遍，发现自己写的代码虽然功能能实现，但是代码很丑，究其原因就是我并没有仔细总结删除操作中三种情况的共性，所以自己写的代码有很多冗余。回头看算导上的伪代码，发现自己还是太naive，认真总结了下三种情形的共同特点，又重新有了收获，以后也可以裸写二叉树的删除操作了。 在本篇中，我只会阐述我对于删除操作的理解，因为前面的遍历、插入、查找等操作都十分简单易懂易实现，当然还有一个前提是需要对二叉树的基本性质有起码的理解。 图1 二叉树删除操作的三种情况:a)被删除节点z没有任何子女 b)被删节点z有一个子女 c)被删节点z有两个子女 总共有三种情况： 被删除节点z没有任何子女。是最简单的情况，将z父节点12的儿子指针置为null，再free掉节点z就好; 被删节点z有且只有有一个子女。这个情况稍微麻烦点，但说起来比较容易，将节点z的父节点15和其唯一子节点20连接起来就好，然后free掉节点z就好; 被删节点z有两个子女。这个是最复杂的，但是其基本思想还是没变，将第三种情况转化为第二种情况处理即可。那么怎么做呢？解决方法就是去找z的后继（后继是什么？就是比节点z中关键字5大的所有节点中最小的那个，说起来很拗口是吧，就是图中关键字为6的节点y）。要删除有两个子女的节点z，就去找它的后继节点y，它的后继节点y能保证只有一个右儿子（为什么？如果它的后继节点有左儿子，那么节点y就不可能是z的后继节点。算导书上p155 练习 12.2-5有要求证明，不懂的可以稍微思考下）。基于上述事实，我们找到了z的后继节点y，那么就已经将情况3转化为了情况2了，接下来要做的操作就是将y的父节点10与y的子节点7连起来。这时还没做完，因为z才是待删除的节点，我们要将节点z出的关键字替换为节点y的关键字，如图中所示。然后free掉节点y。 以上就是对三种情形的处理方法，可以涵盖所有的节点删除可能出现的情形。从上面可以看到，情况2是一般形式，情况1是情况2的最简单形式，情况3是情况2的最复杂形式，但是都可以转化成情况2。有了以上认识，我们就可以看清楚算法导论上伪代码的意图了，也方便我们以后裸写二叉树的删除操作了。下面我解释下伪代码是如何具体实现这些操作的。 第2~4行，是判断待删除节点是什么类型的。如果是有且只有一个子节点或没有子节点的节点，那么y=z。若是有两个子节点的节点，那么就去找它的后继，因此y=TREE-SUCCESSOR(z)，（真正要删除的节点是y）； 第5~7行，是获得节点y的子节点x。因为节点y能保证一定是只有一个儿子的（或者没有儿子，也就是说x==null）； 第8~14行，便是将节点y的子节点和其父节点“连接起来”。 第15~16行，是替换关键字的操作。因为y有可能是z的后继，所以要将节点z的关键字替换为节点y的关键字。最后，删除节点y即可。 finally,贴上我利用c++实现的一系列二叉树操作的代码，请见笑了╭(′▽`)╯：
